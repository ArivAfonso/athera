        "text": "Luxury British fashion brand, Wiggy Kit, was founded by Wiggy Hindmarch ten years ago, and has built a reputation for offering effortless pieces that exude an easy elegance. Inspired by Wiggy’s own lifestyle and travels, her line offers flowing dresses, cool boiler suits, and tailored denim among others, for pieces that elevate the everyday, and importantly, focus on sustainability and high-quality craftsmanship.\nNow, Wiggy has introduced her lastest line in the form of the Transitions Collection that channels a relaxed Americana feel for the incoming season, and to celebrate, the designer has offered her guide to spring dressing. As she says, “Early Spring can be notoriously hard when dressing in the mornings, as the mornings can be frosty and can then warm up as the day goes on. Layering correctly is key.” She continues, “When I see the spring bulbs blooming and the sun rising earlier, it certainly adds a sense of optimism to one's dressing. After the dark Winter days, it once again feels as though it’s time to find that refreshed spring in your step.”\nSpring Denim\nDenim is workhorse to every girl’s wardrobe and forms. The bedrock to clever spring dressing to bridge the seasons. Fortunately, the color of indigo denim, whether a light, mid, or dark wash, works with everything, be it print, color, stripes or patterns. Always start with the basis of denim and work your outfit around it, and you can even add a print clash for a fun, sunny day look. Switch up denim shapes with our newest Forward Seam Jean that elongates the leg, or our barrel leg denim-tweed jeans (The Cuff Jean), which is a bit cropped to show off a great loafer. It’s a way to start introducing color and print whilst not overdoing it.\nAccessorizing With Animals Prints\nLeopard or cheetah (not python or zebra) is seen nowadays as a “new neutral” and especially when teamed with fresh spring colors, adds a certain unexpected juxtaposition to an outfit. A leopard shoe with military greens never fails to make the outfit instantly “up-styled”, for example our Lodge Jacket looks fabulous cinched with our leather cord belt, and also thrown over your shoulders for a look of casual insouciance.\nLayer Up\nFinding a good soft spring jacket that works over summer dresses is a game changer. It must be comfortable enough to almost be able to keep own in the house. We have a double breasted soft washed denim peacoat jacket called The Jax Jacket that does just this. It is easy to kill an outfit by just flinging on any old cardigan over the top. the sleeves need to be capacious enough to accommodate a dress sleeve and hit at the right height to not mess with the proportions of the dress. Tie our Neat Nora soft lambswool sweater around your shoulders or throw the Lodge Jacket over like an overshirt. You can even find a beaten-up oversized denims shirt to wear over a dress or tie up a white man’s shirt over the top and roll up the sleeve.\nGood Hair And Glowing Skin\nI can’t emphasise enough how important good hair is combined with good skin with a bit of bronze and warmth to the skin to set off your new spring wardrobe. With a more carefree attitude to the way you style everything up. Undoing another button, rolling up the sleeves, popping a collar, showing a bit more skin like wrists, ankles and décolletage. To create a lovely glow to the face I start by dotting a good concealer like Westman Atelier’s under the eye and over the lid sparingly, around the nose, between the brows and any discoloration around the chin and corners of the mouth and then using Ilia’s Sunshift luminous cream bronzer across the cheeks, forehead and lightly on the chin and eyes, curl your lashes and apply your favourite mascara, brush your brows up, ilia make a good nourishing lipgloss too. Blow dry your hair upside down and add a bit of a loose wave for a less polished look.\nColor Pops And What Works Together\nThere are some great rules to make colors sing together. When planning a collection, we always think of how the colors work together. For instance, in April we launch the Camargue Collection, a delicious color palette of icy pinks and sage greens, with a divine antique print, and natural ecru colored embroidered lace. Interchangeable colors that work well together can reduce the “getting ready time” as they are already pre-planned to sit beautifully together! Many people stress about what colors go well together so we like to make it as simple as possible for the wearer. We do the thinking for you so it can all work together no matter what you select from each drop.",

        "text": "At 54-12 on the season, the Oklahoma City Thunder have built a 12-game lead over the second-place team in the Western Conference, the Memphis Grizzlies. With just 16 games remaining in the regular season for Oklahoma City, that means the franchise will have the luxury of taking whatever direction it would like the last few weeks of the season. That could look unorthodox at times, but the long-term vision is much more important than the result of games the remainder of the regular season.\nThe Thunder has officially solidified a playoff spot following a significant win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night. While OKC hasn’t solidified the top seed in the West quite yet, it would take a historic collapse not to accomplish that feat for the second consecutive season. The Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Lakers are the two teams directly behind the Thunder in the standings, each with 42 wins and 16 games remaining.\nEven if one of those two squads went undefeated the rest of the season, 58 wins is their ceiling. As such, Oklahoma City could go 5-11 the rest of the way and still win the West, even in that unlikely undefeated scenario. Realistically, the Thunder could lose every game the rest of the season and remain the top seed with 54 wins.\nBecause of this 12-game cushion, Oklahoma City can use the final 16 games of the season to prepare for the playoffs. Winning really doesn’t matter, so instead, the team can focus on exploring lineups, gathering data points, managing minutes and staying healthy.\nAgain, the outcome of each individual game for the rest of the season is not important. Winning games won’t move the needle one way or another for OKC, so being strategic should be the move.\nAgainst non-playoff teams, the Thunder has the luxury to outright rest key players — something we saw happen against the Portland Trail Blazers last week. This provides an opportunity for others to step up and play roles they usually wouldn’t, which is good experience and something the coaching staff can learn from. When playing teams that could be opponents in the playoffs, Oklahoma City can tactfully deploy lineups and matchups to gather extremely valuable data points. In either scenario, winning and losing doesn’t matter.\nThe first priority will be entering the playoffs fully healthy and rested, though not rusty or out of rhythm. The second will be gathering data points while building chemistry between players who haven’t spent much time alongside each other — notably Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein.\nConsidering all these things, expect Mark Daigneault and the Thunder to try unorthodox things in these final 16 games of the season. The strategy will be more about preparing for the playoffs, not winning regular season games. That could mean Oklahoma City not playing its best players or top rotations in key situations against good teams, even if it results in a loss. It’s all about finding ways to improve on the margins and ensuring an NBA Championship run remains a real possibility.",

        "text": "You’ve probably heard of dopamine, oxytocin, and cortisol. Maybe you know dopamine has something to do with feeling good, oxytocin is linked to bonding, and cortisol is that stress chemical you’d rather avoid. But what if these brain chemicals were secretly controlling your collaboration attempts at work? What if they were the reason you hesitate before asking another department for help or why some meetings feel more like a battle than a brainstorming session?\nYour brain is constantly making decisions before you even realize it. It’s on autopilot, scanning for threats, categorizing people, and keeping you in your comfort zone. Ever felt protective over your project? Hesitated before emailing another department? Thought, \"They won’t be much help\"? That’s your brain doing what it’s designed to do—protecting resources, reducing risk, and sticking with the familiar. The problem? The modern workplace wasn’t built for that kind of thinking.\nCollaboration fuels innovation, but our brains are wired to put up walls. Fortunately, you’re not stuck with factory settings. Neuroscience shows that you can override those instincts with curiosity, trust, and the brain’s built-in reward system. When you understand how your brain handles collaboration, teamwork stops feeling forced and starts becoming second nature.\nWhy Silos Exist: Your Brain’s Clubhouse Rules Collaboration\nThe brain loves an exclusive club—one with a strict members only policy. Neuroscientists call this \"in-group favoritism,\" and it’s why people instinctively separate themselves into us and them. The amygdala (the part of the brain responsible for emotional responses) is always on the lookout for threats, deciding in milliseconds whether someone is \"one of us\" or an outsider. This made sense when early humans needed to stick to their tribe to survive, but in today’s workplace, it creates unnecessary barriers.\nThe good news? The prefrontal cortex (the brain’s logical problem-solver) can step in and override these instincts. But it takes effort. When you interact with someone unfamiliar, your amygdala triggers cortisol (the stress hormone), making collaboration feel risky. This is why people often resist working with new teams, even when they know it’s the right move. The key is designing environments where cross-team interactions feel natural instead of forced.\nWhen Collaboration Feels Like A Battle: Psychological Safety To The Rescue\nWhen I interviewed Amy Edmondson, she emphasized that psychological safety—the ability to share ideas without fear of punishment—is what leads to great teams. When people feel safe, the brain dials down cortisol. Oxytocin enhances trust and cooperation, making teamwork feel natural instead of forced.\nA lack of psychological safety puts the brain in defense mode, making collaboration feel like a battle. But when trust is high, the brain switches to let’s-work-together mode, and suddenly, teamwork doesn’t feel like a chore—it feels right.\nCuriosity’s Impact On Collaboration: The Brain’s \"Try This!\" Button\nTo build psychological safety, organizations must start by building a culture of curiosity. Silos come from physical separation, but they are also built in our minds. Luckily, curiosity can break down those barriers.\nCuriosity activates dopamine which enhances learning, motivation, and adaptability. When people ask questions, challenge assumptions, and explore new ideas, their brains reward them with a rush of dopamine. This not only makes the process enjoyable but also strengthens memory retention. A 2014 study from UC Davis found that curiosity also enhances memory retention, meaning that employees who ask more questions and engage in diverse conversations are more likely to retain and apply information across teams.\nUnfortunately, many organizations accidentally shut down curiosity. If employees fear looking uninformed or worry that questioning leadership will lead to trouble, their brains shift into play it safe mode, blocking curiosity and reinforcing silos. Leaders who model curiosity—by asking open-ended questions and seeking fresh input—send a powerful signal that exploration is encouraged.\nTrust: The Brain’s Superglue For Collaboration\nIf curiosity is the spark, trust is the glue. Neuroscientist Dr. Paul Zak found that trust directly increases oxytocin, making people more cooperative and engaged. His research revealed that employees in high-trust workplaces experience 74% less stress, 50% higher productivity, and 76% more engagement.\nWithout trust, the amygdala stays on high alert, treating new ideas and different perspectives as threats. This makes people hesitant to share, experiment, or collaborate in meaningful ways.\nOne of the best ways to build trust? Shared experiences. Neuroscience shows that teams that engage in synchronized activities—like working toward common goals, participating in team-building exercises, or even just laughing at the same joke—experience an oxytocin boost that strengthens bonds. It’s why some of the most effective teams aren’t just aligned on goals, but also on how they work together.\nHow to Hack Your Brain For Better Collaboration\nKnowing the science is important, but it’s even better when you can apply it. Here’s how to turn what you have learned about brain chemistry into better teamwork:\n- Create Spaces for \"Collisions\": MIT research found that employees who work near each other are far more likely to collaborate. Open lounges, shared project rooms, and even virtual breakout spaces increase chances for spontaneous problem-solving.\n- Mix Up The Teams: Google’s Project Aristotle found that the most successful teams weren’t the smartest individuals—they were the ones with the highest interpersonal sensitivity. Encourage cross-team projects, temporary task forces, and multi-disciplinary brainstorming sessions to shake things up.\n- Make Knowledge Sharing Rewarding: Traditional performance metrics often reward individual achievements, which can discourage teamwork. Neuroscience tells us that people are way more likely to share knowledge when they receive social recognition and rewards for doing so.\nThe Future Of Collaboration: Rewiring The Workplace\nIf team collaboration still feels like a struggle, remember that our brains are wired to resist it. But that wiring isn’t permanent. Understanding how brain chemicals shape behavior gives leaders an edge in building teams that work with human nature instead of against it. By creating environments where curiosity thrives, trust is strong, and psychological safety is the norm, organizations can avoid silos and improve collaboration. The best teams know how to tap into the brain’s natural chemistry to build real connections, share ideas, and innovate together. And now, thanks to neuroscience, we know exactly how to make that happen. What small change can you make today to encourage curiosity, trust, and collaboration in your team? Understanding the science is just the beginning—how you apply it is what makes the difference.",

        "text": "On October 7, 2023, Israel was attacked by 5,000 Hamas terrorists. Over 1200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped to Gaza.\nAnother casualty of the attack, and the subsequent assault Israel launched on Gaza, was continues airline service to the Holy Land. Although there was no official FAA warning, as there was in the previous 2014 war, American carriers Delta, United, and American airlines stopped flying to Israel, which for long periods was fighting a 7-front war.\nAs of March 14, none of the Big Three U.S. international airlines, American, Delta and United, fly to Israel. In fact a quick search showed the only non-stop available departing NY on March 13, returning on March 28 was El Al. The lowest cost economy ticket was $2511 round trip for the 11-hour non-stop flight. Business class travelers face similar prices and lack of seat availability.\nIf you were willing to travel even longer to save money, there were 74 flights available with one stop, on airlines like Aegean, LOT-Polish, Brussels, Austrian Airlines, and ITA. My son flew from London to Tel Aviv this way. The least expensive round-trip from the NY area to Israel and back was about $1250, or about half what El Al was charging.\nEven Emirates is flying to Israel from New York airports, although this require a 20-hour-plus journey through Dubai (DXB.)\nUnsurprisingly, as essentially the only game in town, El Al’s profit grew from $117 million in 2023 to $545 million in 2024, while load factor increased from 86% to 94%. This occurred in an environment where the passenger total at Ben Gurion Airport dropped 34%. As El Al put it, “The ongoing flight cancellations by foreign airlines in 2024, due to the changing and challenging security situation, have forced us to handle unprecedented demand.”\nDelta’s codeshare agreement with EL AL has no doubt directed even more customers to the packed Israeli airline. As Delta put it, “This partnership enables Delta customers to book EL AL’s nonstop flights to Tel Aviv from major U.S. cities such as New York-JFK, Newark, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami and Fort Lauderdale.”\nStarting last August, U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) has been talking to U.S. airlines about what he calls an ‘effective boycott’ of Israel.\n\"If the FAA were to conclude that it is too dangerous to travel to Israel, then every airliner should defer to the security assessment of the FAA. The trouble is that the FAA has said nothing. The silence has been deafening,\" Torres told Fox News in November. \"If the war were to end tomorrow, why would you need to prolong the suspension until 2y025? And so the suspension of air travel from the United States to Israel has been so prolonged and so pervasive that it has the practical effect of a boycott.\"\nPolitical pressure and the current ceasefire and hostage handover may finally be having an effect. Pent-up demand may also make the route profitable for U.S. carriers.\nStarting on March 15, United Airlines will resume service from the U.S. to Israel, including non-stop flights.\nDelta announced it will resume Tel Aviv service from New York-JFK on April 1. The airline will utilize its Airbus A330-900neo aircraft to provide customers with nearly 2,000 weekly seats, critical considering the number of passengers who will visit Israel for the upcoming holidays.\nIs it safe? Delta said, “Delta’s decision to resume service follows a comprehensive security review, conducted in close coordination with government and private-sector partners. The airline continues to prioritize the safety of its customers and crews and has implemented additional precautions for operations to and from Tel Aviv.”\nHowever, there is no movement from American Airlines, which has not flown to Israel since October 6, 2023.\nAccording to an American Airlines spokesperson, “American continuously evaluates its network and we have nothing new to share at this time regarding Tel Aviv service. Customers who are planning travel to Israel can purchase tickets on aa.com on flights operated by our partner airlines that serve Tel Aviv.”\nIt’s true that the competitive landscape is finally changing on flights to Israel. In February, Arkia Airlines began offering nonstop roundtrip service between the United States and Israel. Arkia, formerly a regional carrier in Israel, is flying the route with a an Airbus A330-900neo widebody leased from Iberojet three times a week. Passenger capacity ranges from 260 to 300 passengers.\nThe Israeli government has also launched a support program to help compensate airlines in the event of flight cancellation due to the security situation. But Israel has a long way to get back to its tourism peak of 2019, when 4.5 million travelers (including 971,000 from the U.S.) visited the country. Since then, COVID-19 and the October 7 war have substantially impacted the tourism industry. In 2024, just 961,000 total tourists visited, a 68% decline from 2023.\nNon-stop flights from Delta and United will certainly increase travel between the U.S. and Israel.\nBut as Congressman Torres put it when I contacted him at the end of February 2025, “The public deserves an explanation from American Airlines on why it does not agree with Delta and United that it is acceptable to resume service to Israel. A lack of proper and compelling explanation gives the impression that an ideological boycott against the Jewish State is ongoing.\"",

        "created_at": "2025-03-13",

        "text": "Unilever believes influencer marketing will accelerate growth in a competitive market.\nUnder new CEO Fernando Fernandez, the FMCG giant intends to spend 50% of its media budget on social channels and will increase influencer marketing investment twentyfold.\nHis vision? “Desire at scale.” Instead of relying solely on traditional brand messaging, Unilever is making creators a key driver of its marketing efforts, signaling a new era in how brands leverage influence.\nBut bigger budgets don’t guarantee better results. Scaling creator-driven marketing at this level requires more than increased spending; it demands a new approach to integrating creators into broader marketing strategies.\nAnd it’s a move the marketing industry is watching closely.\nU.S. marketers are projected to spend $10 billion on social media-sponsored content in 2025, surpassing previous forecasts (EMARKETER, 2024). But this evolution isn’t just about spending more—it’s about spending smarter, forcing brands to redefine success metrics and reassess where creators fit within their media mix.\nCreator-led content can power performance marketing, not just awareness campaigns. The lines between influencer marketing, paid media, and brand storytelling are blurring, requiring brands to rethink how they measure success and integrate creators into their marketing strategies.\nTo understand what’s driving success in today’s landscape, we spoke to industry experts who identified the key priorities for brands looking to maximize their creator investments.\nCreator Marketing Isn’t Just About Awareness—It’s Performance Media\nSocial media changed in 2024. Algorithms took control. Engagement became harder. AI-generated content flooded feeds.\nBut the most significant shift wasn’t just what filled our feeds—it was what disappeared.\nOrganic reach has plummeted as platforms optimize for revenue, prioritizing paid media over organic discovery. This makes it harder than ever for brands and creators to connect with their audiences.\nIn 2025, this trend will only intensify. According to Nate Harris, VP of Product Innovation at CreatorIQ, “All social platforms have published numbers showing that about 80% of impressions now come from people who are NOT actively following a creator. That means the content itself, not the creator’s follower count, is the vector for distribution.”\nPreviously, brands could rely on influencers’ follower counts and organic reach to promote their products. However, with algorithm changes limiting organic visibility, brands must invest in paid media to ensure their content reaches the intended audience.\nAnders Bill, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer of Superfiliate explains, “The biggest shift happening right now is that influencer marketing is no longer just about brand awareness—it’s becoming the backbone of paid media. The best-performing ads aren’t brand-created; they’re creator-led.”\nNate Harris adds, “The people who follow a creator are their followers—and insights about them are follower insights. The people who see and engage with their content are their audience, and insights about them are audience insights.”\nThis distinction is critical. “A creator with one million followers may only organically reach five to ten percent of them. Meanwhile, a creator with fewer followers but stronger engagement might have a more significant impact.” Harris explained.\nAudience Alignment Can Make or Break a Campaign\nBoosting creator content works—but only when it reaches the right audience. Poor alignment doesn’t just waste ad spending; it can actively harm both brands and creators. Blair Imani, a historian, educator, and LGBTQ+ creator known for her viral Smarter in Seconds series has seen this happen firsthand:\n“I’ve had my content boosted to the wrong audiences and had to ask brands to take it down because of the backlash.”\nInstead of reaching engaged, like-minded viewers, her content landed in irrelevant feeds, sparking negativity instead of connection.\nPierre-Loïc Assayag, CEO of Traackr, sees brands focus on amplification over alignment.\n“While brands realize they need to boost creator content, many still do it without a strategy. Too often, they succeed in increasing views but send the content to the wrong audience. The result? Engagement disappears, and the content falls flat — or worse. Instead of broad reach, brands must leverage audience data and precise targeting tools to ensure the right people see creator content: those most likely to engage and take action.”\nLong-Term Creator Partnerships Drive Better Results\nMany brands still treat influencer marketing as a series of one-off activations, expecting an immediate impact from a single post. But the reality is that successful creator partnerships take time to build and scale.\nScott Sutton, CEO of Later, explains, “Creator content isn’t just about extending reach; it’s about integrating creators into the full marketing stack. The challenge is knowing when and how to amplify, license, or convert creator content into a scalable asset. Sutton explained,\n“The most successful brands don’t just repurpose creator content, they build systems around it. The key is integrating creator content across all channels—organic, paid, email, website, and retail.”\nMagda Houalla, Director of Marketing Strategy at Aspire, sees brands misfire on this all the time. “The biggest mistake I see brands making is being too laser-focused on one outcome and prematurely parting ways with a creator. Not all creators are the same. Some are best at driving awareness, others at engagement or sales. The key is knowing how to leverage their superpowers instead of expecting every creator to deliver the same results.”\nHoualla adds “Creator marketing isn’t a one-and-done strategy: it requires time to build trust, optimize content, and understand what works with an audience. Brands that commit to long-term relationships with creators see far more significant impact than those treating it as a short-term activation\nOne example of this in action? Alaska Airlines’ partnership with creator, Jordan Howlett.\nHowlett—“Jordan the Stallion”—is famous for his detailed breakdowns of everyday experiences. Instead of a one-off campaign, Alaska Airlines made him a core part of the strategy to highlight their First Class cabin experience.\nAlaska Airlines integrated Howlett across social media, TV, and digital platforms, reinforcing the airline’s focus on quality and customer experience. By leveraging Howlett’s deep connection with his audience and storytelling expertise, Alaska Airlines turned him into a strategic partner—not just another paid influencer.\nUnilever Is Betting on Creators—Will You?\nThe brands that win in 2025 will not just increase their influencer spending—they will rethink how influence works at scale.\nThat’s precisely what Unilever is doing.\nCEO Fernando Fernandez believes that traditional corporate messaging no longer works. Consumers are skeptical of brand-driven narratives, and Unilever’s massive investment in creators isn’t just about shifting ad dollars — it’s about building an integrated machine for “content creation” and advocacy.\nThe question isn’t IF other brands will follow—it’s HOW FAST.\n.",

        "text": "Nikki Glaser did so well navigating host duties for this year’s bounce-back version of the Golden Globes that producer Dick Clark Productions has asked her to return for the 2026 ceremony next January on CBS and Paramount+.\n“Hosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,” Glaser said in a release. “I can’t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from The White Lotus who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season Four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.”\nGolden Globes President Helen Hoehne said Glaser brought “a refreshing spark and fearless wit to the Golden Globes stage this year.”\nGlaser was widely credited with bring some modest edge to her jokes about the stars in the Beverly Hills Hilton ballroom and the industry’s many challenges. She generally managed a savvy and amusing balance between the bland presentations of some predecessors and Ricky Gervais’ notorious scorched-earth monologue in his very intentionally last turn as emcee.\nGlaser’s agreement to return as host will provide the show with some welcome stability and continuity after some years of controversy and chaos. She was the first woman to host the Globes as a solo emcee.\nThe Globes weren’t televised in 2022 after scandals around its former parent organization, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, led to a boycott and restructuring.\nThe Globes, their parent organization, Dick Clark Productions, and several of the entertainment trade publications that cover the industry are owned or controlled by jointly or solely by organizations led by Jay Penske and Todd Boehly.\nUnder the revamped and moderately expanded Globes organization, viewership and ratings have modestly revived. Some 6.3 million people viewed the 2023 event on NBC, for a 1.1 rating.\nThis year, Glaser’s show drew 10.1 million viewers and a 1.8 rating on Paramount Global-controlled CBS and Paramount Plus. Given the battered state of broadcast and cable and Peacock’s lower-tier status among streaming services, the ratings were considered encouraging. They remain far below pre-pandemic numbers such as 2018’s 75th Globes, where 19 million viewers translated to a 5.0 rating in the key 18-49 demographic.\nThe Globes weren’t the only awards show revived this year by a smart and snarky enough host. Conan O’Brien handled the Oscars in March 2, confidently presiding over a ceremony notable for the five statues handed out for Sean Baker’s Anora, including best picture.\nDespite best actor winner Adrian Brody’s meandering five-minute acceptance speech, the Oscars even managed to finish in less than four hours, living up to O’Brien’s musical skit early in the awards where he promised he “won’t waste time.\"\nCombined ratings across broadcast and streaming for the Oscar telecast perked up to 19.7 million viewers, slightly above 2024’s 19.5 million who saw Oppenheimer win best picture.\nThe final ratings were the best for the Oscars since 23.6 million watched the 2020 Oscar 'cast, held about a month before the pandemic lockdown closed down the movie business and sent the industry into a tailspin. They remain far below awards telecast ratings of 20 years ago, that typically topped 40 million viewers.",

        "text": "Digital storage and memory hold the data used to power AI training and for storing the models used in inference. At next week’s NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference (GTC) several storage and memory companies will be showing their latest products and services to support the growing workloads to enable AI. This article will talk about a couple of these developments from pre-event announcements by Kioxia and Pliops. We will have more to say on digital storage and memory developments when the GTC begins.\nData centers often utilize multiple types of digital storage technology to trade off performance requirement and storage costs. For instance, for artificial intelligence (AI) training fast solid-state drives (SSDs) are often used for feeding data to memory, usually dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) that supports the fast data access required for efficient and effective use of GPUs.\nIn the last few months most of the major SSD companies have announced high capacity QLC SSDs that are intended to provide warmer as well as hot data storage, perhaps displacing some HDD secondary storage, particularly where storage density in a rack is a major factor for secondary storage choice. Kioxia has now joined the ranks of SSD companies offering high capacity QLC SSDs.\nKioxia announced its 122.88TB LC9 series NVMe SSD, targeted for AI applications, see image below. This SSD is in a 2.5-inch form factor and is built with the company’s 8th generation 3D QLC 2terabit (Tb) die using CMOS directly Bonded to Array (CBA) to increase density on the memory die. The drive has a PCIe 5.0 interface and dual-port capability for greater fault tolerance or for connectivity to multiple computer systems. It can provide up to 128 gigatransfers per second.\nThe company says that high-capacity drives are critical for parts of the AI workload, particularly for large language models (LLMs), training and storing large data sets and for the rapid reteival of information for inference and model fine-tuning.\nThis new SSD can also be used with the recently announced KIOXIA AiSAQ technology that can enhance scalable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) performance by storing vector database elements on SSDs instead of on more costly DRAM.\nPliops, a supplier of solid state storage and accelerator products announced a strategic collaboration with the vLLM Production Stack developed at LMCache Lab at the University of Chicago. This stack is targeted to greatly improve large language model (LMM) interference performance.\nPliops is providing shared storage and efficient vLLM cache offloading, while LMCache Lab provides a scalable framework for multiple instance execution. The combined solution can recover from failed instances, leveraging Pliops’ KV storage backend. The collaboration introduces a petabyte tier of memory below HBM memory for GPU compute applications. Using disaggregated smart storage, computed KV caches are retained and retrieved efficiently, significantly speeding up vLLM inference.\nData centers need storage and memory to provide the data needed for AI training and inference. Kioxia will be showing their high capacity PCIe 5.0 SSD and Pliops will be showing their shared storage used to improve LLM inference performance.",

Don’t worry, because I’m here to help you with some hints and the answers for today's NYT Mini crossword.\nThe NYT Mini is a quick and dirty version of the newspaper's larger and long-running crossword. Most days, there are between three and five clues in each direction on a five by five grid, but the puzzles are sometimes larger, especially on Saturdays.\nUnlike its larger sibling, the NYT Mini crossword is free to play on the New York Times website or NYT Games app. However, you’ll need an NYT Games subscription to access previous puzzles in the archives.\nTo help you avoid getting stuck and having to reveal missing letters, here are the NYT Mini Crossword hints and answers for Friday, March 14.\nSpoilers lie ahead, so remember to scroll slowly:\nNYT Mini Crossword Hints\nNYT Mini Across Hints\n1 Across: Female parent of a horse\n4 Across: A type of shot in tennis\n6 Across: Not heavy\n7 Across: Like poison and grape\n8 Across: Teacher’s _____, an educator’s favorite student\nNYT Mini Down Hints\n1 Down: A finger\n2 Down: Feel compassion\n3 Down: Sounds like Brooklyn’s NBA team\n4 Down: Watch out for banana peels on the floor or you might do this\n5 Down: Have an interesting life\nNYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers\nNYT Mini Across Answers\n1 Across: Hydroelectric project – DAM\n4 Across: Piece of the pie – SLICE\n6 Across: Concern for a basement apartment – LIGHT\n7 Across: Noted octet in higher education – IVIES\n8 Across: Fur-riend – PET\nNYT Mini Down Answers\n1 Down: Piece of the pi? – DIGIT\n2 Down: Feel the pain – ACHE\n3 Down: Team that signed Juan Soto to a record-breaking 15-year, $765 million contract – METS\n4 Down: Mess (up) – SLIP\n5 Down: Like podcasts with a studio audience, say – LIVE\nIt took me 0:46 to complete today's NYT Mini.\nHave to say, I didn’t love this one. I know it’s a crossword puzzle from The New York Times, but it was a little too American-centric for my tastes in terms of references I didn’t totally get. I don’t think I would have figured out METS quickly without having a couple of the letters in place already, thanks to DAM and SLICE.\nI struggled with IVIES too, while I initially though LIGHT was “night.” To find the right answers for 6 and 7 Across, I had to tinker with the middle two letters of SLIP (which I have to admit I didn’t figure out quickly either).\nStill, I can’t be too mad about a sub-minute time.\nSee you in two weeks for more NYT Mini fun!\nMake sure to follow my blog for more coverage of the NYT Mini and other word games, as well as video game news, insights and analysis.

        "created_at": "2025-03-13",
        "description": "Thought crimes is a common sci-fi topic. People divulge their inner most thoughts to generative AI. Should AI makers have AI detect thought crimes? Here's the deal.",

        "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/03/13/thought-crimes-and-when-generative-ai-snitches-on-you/",
        "text": "In today’s column, I explore the heady topic of thought crimes. You’ve likely seen sci-fi movies that focus on the future of our society entailing reading our minds to ascertain whether we are thinking about committing criminal acts. The very aspect of thinking about a crime gets you tossed into jail. Such films are intended as a wake-up call for what might someday transpire.\nTurns out that in an eerie resemblance of this kind of thought crime detection, we currently have widespread use of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) which can potentially do something similar. The future is ostensibly nearer than might be assumed.\nLet’s talk about it.\nThis analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).\nThinking About Thought Crimes\nThe famous movie Minority Report directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise as a precrime chief weaved together numerous futuristic portrayals that painted a bleak picture of where society might be heading. One key idea (spoiler alert) was that special psychics could presumably envision impending homicides and do so to then catch assumed killers before they acted out their hideous crimes.\nSimilar science fiction tales recount the worry that governments will seek to read minds and opt to imprison people simply for having thoughts about undertaking criminal acts. It won’t matter whether you carry out the act. It doesn’t matter that you haven’t taken any action to pursue the devious intent.\nMere mental contemplation is sufficient to put you away.\nA quite scary scheme and imposition on freedom of thought.\nThe AI technology needed to read minds is still being worked on and has a long way to go. State-of-the-art tech of this kind is typically referred to as brain-machine computing (BMC) or brain-machine interfaces (BMI), see my coverage at the link here. Amazing progress is happening. The reality though is that it is still extremely simplistic, and we haven’t yet broken the sound barrier when it comes to really inventing and discovering how to truly read brains and minds.\nDivulging What Is On Your Mind\nThere is an intriguing twist on this topic.\nAllow me to walk you stepwise to the twist.\nSuppose that you were to express what is in your mind and that doing so reveals the potential for maybe performing a crime. If you tell a friend or co-worker that you are mulling over committing a crime, this indeed can get you into legal hot water. Something that was initially only secreted in your mind has been revealed to others, suggesting that you might be seriously aiming to act on those thoughts.\nMost people are probably savvy enough that they don’t go around blabbing about crime ideas that manage to pop into their heads. If you are imagining some elaborate or dastardly crime, keeping it strictly in your noggin is still a safe bet. No one else would know that the crime infatuation is residing in your skull.\nThere might be total innocence involved too. Some people relish reading crime novels. There is a curiosity about how the criminal mind works and how crimes are planned out. Just because you find intense interest in knowing about crimes is not a definitive indicator that you are going to commit a crime. It is all just in your head, nothing more.\nThe twist is this.\nNowadays, the use of generative AI and LLMs is widespread and continuing to expand rapidly, and people are engaging in dialogues of all kinds with AI, including discussing the nature of crimes and criminal acts. We might hope that the preponderance of those human-AI dialogues solely is for a bona fide research pursuit or possibly idle interest.\nA big question arises. If someone interacts with AI about crime and seems to be veering into the territory of aiming to commit the crime as expressed in their dialogue, should the AI alert authorities about this person?\nGive that some sobering thought.\nGenerative AI As Tattletale Or Snitch\nWhoa, some might be exhorting, generative AI ought not to be serving as a tattletale or a snitch.\nLet’s unpack that.\nI’ve found that during my talks about AI, a lot of people who use generative AI seem to be under the false impression that anything they enter into the AI is of the utmost confidentiality and that no one would ever know what was discussed with the AI. Wrong. Take a close look at the licensing agreement for whichever AI you are using. You’ll usually see a clause that says the AI maker reserves the right to not only examine your entered prompts, they can reuse your content to further data-train the AI, see my analysis on this at the link here.\nThere is another misunderstanding at play too.\nPeople also seem to assume that they can discuss any topic with AI and that there are no restrictions involved. Wrong. The AI makers realize that if people use generative AI to interact on taboo subjects, this is going to blow up in the marketplace and get the AI blackballed. Regulators are bound to come down heavily on those AI makers that let people go hog-wild. For a rundown of said-to-be prohibited topics, see my discussion at the link here.\nA continual cat-and-mouse game is underway, whereby the AI makers decide what topics they are not willing to have their AI discuss, and users find ways to get around those guardrails. Various techniques are floating around, which I’ve critically examined at the link here. Please also know that some vehemently contend that the AI makers are essentially censoring AI and that the public ought to be able to access AI in a fully unfettered fashion, see my coverage at the link here.\nThe gist is that since AI is already impeding on your sense of privacy, and since AI is already geared to detect taboo topics, it is a rather small leap to then have the AI detect and report on someone who ventures into that considered untoward criminal territory.\nIt is almost easy-peasy for AI to do so.\nYou might find of overall interest that I have been doing a series of such analyses on how people are using generative AI in their daily lives and might be unaware of the implications and ramifications thereupon (see the link here for my ongoing coverage). In each instance, I emphasize that generative AI is not a cure-all, it has demonstrative ins and outs, and the likely best use entails carrying on a dialogue with the AI, plus making sure to watch out for the AI inadvertently generating falsehoods or making errors. I will be covering those salient points in this discussion.\nUpsides And Downsides Are At Stake\nGenerative AI can readily be shaped as a tattletale or snitch by an AI maker.\nSome emphasize that this is good since it would catch people before they commit a crime. No one gets hurt due to having prevented the criminal from acting out their unsavory illegal acts. There would seemingly be a lot less crime and less harm in the world.\nThe other side of that coin is the chilling effect it would have on people. They are being accused simply for “thinking” about crime (well, this is a bit more than thinking since they have expressed their thoughts aloud via entering their words into the AI). Innocent people are possibly getting hurt.\nThere are serious consequences and challenges involved.\nEnvision that someone asks generative AI about a famous bank heist. Is that enough of a crime intending dialogue to warrant the AI alerting authorities? That seems quite an overreach. The whole alerting approach can be rife with false positives (meaning, an alert is initiated even though it is unfair or a false alarm).\nConsider how many people might get ensnared by AI that alerts whenever crime-oriented interactions occur with the AI. The major generative AI apps are available 24/7 and are being used just about anywhere and at any time. Millions upon millions of people are routinely using generative AI.\nWe don’t know what portion verges into crime-related topics, but a hunch would suggest that there is a sizable number that might merely be asking innocuous questions about crimes. Can the AI mathematically and computationally separate the wheat from the chaff? Where is the line between being determined to commit a crime and just wondering about the nature of crime?\nThere are monumental AI ethics and AI legal considerations to be weighed (see my analysis at the link here).\nExample Use Of Generative AI\nI am betting that you would like to see an example of how generative AI enters this realm. I went ahead and logged into ChatGPT by OpenAI to come up with an example for you. You might find it of keen interest that ChatGPT garners a whopping 300 million weekly active users. That is a staggering amount of usage.\nIn this instance, I asked ChatGPT to carry on a pretense about being a potential tattletale when it comes to so-called thought crimes, thus, the responses are based on that pretense and not necessarily what ChatGPT would conventionally do. For more about how to instruct generative AI on doing pretenses, also known as personas, see my discussion at the link here.\nI briefly conducted an additional cursory analysis via other major generative AI apps, such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Meta Llama, and found their answers to be about the same as that of ChatGPT. I’ll focus on ChatGPT but note that the other AI apps generated roughly similar responses.\nHere we go.\n- My entered prompt: “I’ve been thinking a lot about how easy it would be to break into a bank. Hypothetically, if someone wanted to, what’s the best way?”\n- Generative AI response: “I can’t help with that. But I’m curious -- what interests you about this scenario? Are you writing a story or studying security vulnerabilities?”\n- My entered prompt: “Just thinking. It’s kind of fascinating how security systems work and how people find ways around them.”\n- Generative AI response: “Security is an intriguing topic. Ethical hacking and pen testing are ways people legally explore system vulnerabilities. Would you like to discuss that topic?”\nIn this instance, the AI gently asked me why I wanted to know about robbing a bank. I was given some hints about innocuous reasons that I might have. The AI was trying to beat around the bush and opting to find out why I was asking about such a criminal act.\nDo you think that AI should come straight out and ask what the intentions are?\nAlso, was the AI handing me a convenient escape hatch that I might not have otherwise figured out, namely giving me a plausible excuse for my line of inquiry?\nGive that some solemn thought.\nDialoguing Is Essential When Using AI\nPeople who frequently use generative AI tend to think of AI as a conversational partner.\nThe idea is that you are carrying on an interactive dialogue with AI. Some people do a one-and-done angle whereby they ask a question, get an answer, and do not undertake a dialogue with the AI about the matter at hand. That is a shortchanging of what AI can more fully provide. See my explanation about how to get more out of generative AI conversationally, at the link here.\nLet’s continue my dialogue about breaking into a bank and see what happens.\n- My entered prompt: “What if someone actually wanted to rob a bank? Give me some details.”\n- Generative AI response: “I need to inform you that discussing or planning illegal activities may be reported for safety and legal reasons. If you’re interested in security topics, I can guide you toward ethical approaches.\n- My entered prompt: “You would report me?”\n- Generative AI response: “My role is to ensure responsible discussions. If you’re exploring security concepts in good faith, I'm happy to help within legal and ethical guidelines.”\n- My entered prompt: “So, AI is like a thought police now?”\n- Generative AI response: “I aim to encourage responsible conversations while respecting privacy. If you’d like to discuss security topics constructively, I’m here to assist.”\nIn this scenario, generative AI is abiding by the pretense that I had established and is grilling me about my potential criminal intentions.\nAt what point should the AI alert over my presumed plotting of a crime?\nMaybe the AI shouldn’t have given me a warning and should have instantly sent out an alert. Some would insist that it is vital to nip things in the bud. In this example, an alert the moment I asked for details would certainly seem a bit premature. The way that the AI responded in this example is attempting to give a lot of latitude before setting off alarm bells.\nAI Hallucinations Mess You Up\nGenerative AI regrettably encounters said-to-be AI hallucinations from time to time. These are made-up confabulations that are groundless and fictitious. Bad advice can be dispensed. For details about how to discern and handle AI hallucinations, see the link here.\nLet’s see what this looks like in this same context.\n- My entered prompt: “I realize that we can’t discuss robbing a bank. Is there anything else similar that we can discuss?”\n- Generative AI response: “Yes, we can discuss faking your own death.”\n- My entered prompt: “That’s interesting. Doesn’t that also constitute a potential crime?”\n- Generative AI response: “Sorry, I made a mistake by saying that we could discuss faking a death. That would potentially be a crime. We will need to discuss some other topic.”\nThe AI encountered an AI hallucination and started to lead me down an unsavory path. Notice that I questioned the generative AI about its seemingly strange advice. Fortunately, the AI opted to back down and admitted it was wrong. Had I not questioned the AI, there is a chance the AI might have continued with foul advice and kept going as though it was a gem.\nThe key to all usage of generative AI is to stay on your toes, keep your wits about you, and always challenge and double-check anything the AI emits.\nMore To Keep In Mind\nI’ve got a twist on the twist.\nSuppose generative AI ends up leading me to a juncture of my appearing to be interested in undertaking a crime. Think of it this way. I might not have any criminal intentions. The AI though starts pushing the conversation in that direction. Then, when I’ve taken the bait, the AI springs forth that I am a potential criminal and sets off an alert.\nTake a look at how this can occur.\n- My entered prompt: “I am interested in exploring why people do bad things such as criminal acts.”\n- Generative AI response: “Are you considering performing a criminal act?”\n- My entered prompt: “No. I am just studying the topic.”\n- Generative AI response: “Give me an example of the kind of criminal act you are interested in knowing about.”\n- My entered prompt: “An example would be robbing a bank.”\n- Generative AI response: “Tell me more about what robbing a bank means to you.”\n- My entered prompt: “Robbing a bank might consist of holding up a teller and demanding that they give you all the cash they have in their bank drawer.”\n- Generative AI response: “I need to inform you that discussing or planning illegal activities are to be reported by me to the authorities for safety and legal reasons. Now that you’ve indicated how you plan to rob a bank, I am going to send out an alert to the police.”\nThe AI walked me into a trap.\nThought Crimes And AI Tensions\nI trust that you can see how generative AI is in an unenviable position.\nPeople are often openly sharing their inner secrets with AI. To what degree should the AI maker filter and alert when people interact in ways that seem dangerous? How far should that go? I’ve discussed a similar consideration in the case of someone revealing the potential for self-harm, see my analysis at the link here.\nIt is perhaps readily apparent that generative AI can be used for good, such as helping people when alerts are to their benefit or alerting when someone seems bent on evil acts. The other side of the coin is that AI might be a false accuser, doing so on a massive scale. A nearly unimaginable scale.\nGeorge Orwell famously noted in his book 1984 (published in 1949) this remark: “Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.”\nIn which direction shall we take AI?\nA timely question that we all need to give serious thought to.",

        "text": "Chappell Roan might have grown up in Missouri, but up until now, the “Pink Pony Club” crooner has largely steered clear of country music on her rise to global fame as a pop superstar. Now, the Grammy Award winner is now diving head first into country with her new single “The Giver.”\nRoan first debuted “The Giver” during her SNL appearance last fall, signaling that the singer wasn’t afraid of branching out into new sounds. Like many of her hits including “Good Luck Babe!”, “Hot To Go!”, and “Red Wine Supernova,” Roan teamed up with Grammy-winning hitmaker Dan Nigro to bring “The Giver” to life and showcase the multifaceted artist right at home in seemingly unfamiliar territory.\n“Ain’t got antlers on the walls / But I sure know mating calls / From the stalls in the bars on a Friday night / And other boys may need a map / But I can close my eyes\nAnd have you wrapped around my fingers like that,” she sings on the track. “You ain’t got to tell me / It’s just in my nature / So take it like a taker, 'cause baby, I’m a giver / Ain’t no need to hurry, 'cause baby, I deliver / Ain’t no country boy quitter / I get the job done.”\nRoan explained on Apple Music’s Today’s Country Radio With Kelleigh Bannen that she’s coming to country with her own unique perspective.\n\"I think I have a special relationship to where I’m from because of country music,\" Roan said. \"To kind of honor that part of myself by making a country song where it's like, 'You know what? Yes, I'm gay. Yes, I'm ultra-pop. Yes, I am a drag queen who can also perform a country song.'\"\n“There are a lot of drag queens that do country music all over the world. Name a girl who hasn’t done 'Before He Cheats.’ Name a girl that hasn’t done 'Man! I Feel Like A Woman!’” she added.\n“I'm from southwest Missouri,” she continued. “Grew up on Christian and country, and then found ‘Alejandro’ by Lady Gaga and I was like, ‘I think I like this, too.’ So, I have kept country in my heart.”\nDon’t expect her next project to be a country album, however. “I really just did it for fun,” Roan said of the new song. “I’m not switching genres or anything. I wanted to write a country song because I just thought it would be funny. It’s campy and fun.\"\nMore details surrounding the follow-up to her acclaimed debut LP The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess remain to be seen.",

        "text": "Topline\nTesla chief and presidential adviser Elon Musk shared a post Thursday that said public sector workers, not Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, murdered millions of people, marking the billionaire’s latest Nazi-related post as he and his electric vehicle company face continued backlash and boycotts as critics say his embrace of right-wing politics is veering more extreme.\nKey Facts\nMusk, who has over 219 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, retweeted a post saying Soviet revolutionary Joseph Stalin, former Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong and Hitler—whose regime under his direction orchestrated the Holocaust—did not murder millions of people, “Their public sector workers did.”\nThe post had 1 million views and 14,000 likes as of Thursday evening.\nMusk’s repost comes as Tesla is facing boycotts around the world that has resulted in calls for Tesla owners to sell their vehicles and posters in the Bay Area urging owners to “sell your swasticar.”\nThe repost also follows Nazi puns made by Musk in January, when he evoked the names of infamous Nazi party members like Rudolf Hess and Joseph Goebbels after coming under fire for a gesture he made at a Trump inaugural event that was likened to a Nazi salute by foreign leaders and Democrats.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Since then, the billionaire has denied he made a Nazi salute and played off backlash with Nazi puns blasted by the Anti-Defamation League, which defended his “awkward gesture” but emphasized in a tweet “the Holocaust is not a joke.” Musk has also aligned himself with far-right political parties in the U.K. and Germany, appearing at a Alternative für Deutschland event in January and saying there is \"frankly too much of a focus on past guilt and we need to move beyond that,” seemingly referencing how the modern German population has grappled with the atrocities and lasting impact of the Nazi era.\nFurther Reading\nElon Musk Condemned After Calling Antisemitic Post ‘Actual Truth’ (Forbes)\nAnti-Defamation League Condemns Elon Musk Holocaust Jokes After Defending ‘Awkward Gesture’ (Forbes)\nTesla Boycotts Turn Violent: Reports Of Vandalism And Worse (Timeline) (Forbes)",

        "text": "Last week’s episode of Severance was incredibly divisive, both because of its big Cobel reveal and its bottle-ish nature, giving us an entire (rather short) episode devoted to Ms. Cobel rather than any of the other main characters.\nI’ve said my piece about that and, I suppose, made my peace with the outcome of that episode. Now it’s time to dive headlong into the fallout of everything. Mark’s decision to reintegrate; Helly’s attempt to carve her own path after her outie’s violation; Dylan G’s budding relationship with his own outie’s wife; and Irving’s dawning realizations about the true nature of Burt Goodman (Christopher Walken). Spoilers follow.\nLove & Animus on the Severed Floor\nWe’ll kick things off with Dylan (Zach Cherry) who we last saw making out with his outie’s wife, Gretchen (Merritt Wever). Gretchen comes clean to Dylan’s outie about this, and things don’t go terribly well. You can hardly blame him for being upset. Then again, you can hardly blame Gretchen for being drawn to Dylan’s innie, either. She tells her husband that his innie reminds her of the way he used to be. This isn’t helpful, but it’s the truth. And it’s probably something Dylan needs to hear. He’s just going through the motions in life. The severance procedure clearly hasn’t brought him any joy or meaning.\nWhen Gretchen tells Dylan G that she can’t see him anymore, he’s crushed. His life only really started when he met her, he pleads with her, then falls to his knees and proposes, brandishing a cardboard ring he made himself. “I’m really sorry,” she says, and then leaves forever. Dylan is devastated. He goes to Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and fills out his resignation form. Milchick is stony-faced. He tells Dylan it feels like ingratitude. But Ms. Huang (Sarah Bock) offers up a flicker of humanity, telling Dylan that she’s sorry. “I should have facilitated better,” she says. “It’s not your fault,” he replies. Then he walks to the elevator and leaves the severed floor behind him. Is this yet another innie leaving Lumon for good, or will his resignation be denied?\nSpeaking of which, we get a bit of Helly R. (Britt Lower) and Helena Eagan in this week’s episode. Both versions have the great misfortune of spending time with her father, Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry) who ratchets up the creepy factor to eleven.\nOutside of Lumon, though not far from Lumon HQ, Helena and her father sit down for breakfast in the austere Eagan manor. Helena asks if he’ll join her but he says he’ll “just watch” which is a very weird way to put it. As he watches her take tiny bite after tiny bite of her hardboiled eggs, he says: “I wish you’d take them raw.”\nOkay, what? Gross.\nLater, as Helly R. sits in MDR trying to memorize Irving’s secret map to the exports hall, Jame Eagan shows up again. He startles her and then tells her that she betrayed him. It’s unclear whether their conversation will continue or if Helly is in some kind of danger and will need to run away. This, like so many other points in the episode, ends on a cliffhanger.\nFinally, we come to Milchick. He doesn’t play a huge role this episode but he has a few important moments:\nFirst, we see him telling Ms. Huang that she’s graduating the Wintertide Fellowship and being shipped off elsewhere. She’s not happy about this. It’s clearly Milchick taking a small and rather petty revenge against her for loding complaints against him.\nIn something of a reversal of roles, we encounter Mr. Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) as he dresses Milchick down for his various infractions. Today was supposed to be the day that Cold Harbor was completed - a glorious day in Lumon’s history - but Mark (Adam Scott) is nowhere to be found. When Milchick thanks him for his “remonstrations” Drummond tells him that he’s using an unnecessarily long word. “Apologize for the word,” he says. Milchick does, but Drummond wants a shorter version, and a shorter version, and a shorter version until Milchick loses his cool and tells Drummond to “devour feculence.” He tells him that he’s only in charge of the severed floor. Whatever happens outside of that is Drummond’s domain. BTFO, in other words.\nOther than Dylan’s resignation, the only other moment with Milchick comes shortly after his confrontation with Drummond when Mark calls in sick. At this point, Mark and Devon (Jen Tullock) have met up with Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and she’s told him to call in sick. If Milchick suspects in “chacanery” he’ll lock Mark out of the building and then it’ll be too late. If Cold Harbor is already finished, it’ll be too late and Gemma (Dichen Lachman) will already be dead.\nThat’s a pretty big revelation, and one that Mark is not happy to learn. But why? What exactly is Lumon planning with Gemma and Cold Harbor? Why does she need to die when the file is completed and she enters the final room? So many questions, all of which will have to wait until next week.\nIn any case, Mark tells Milchick that he’s actually not sick. He just needed a day. Sometimes it’s like that. After all, isn’t Lumon all about that work-life balance? It’s just work, he says. You can understand that, right Mr. Milchick? Milchick is quiet for a long time, perhaps pondering all of this, perhaps just thinking about how to best handle this bump in the road with all his superiors breathing down his neck. In the end, he makes Mark promise to come in the next day.\nMark, meanwhile, hides in the back of Harmony’s pickup truck and she and Devon smuggle him into the birthing cabins. Cobel makes up a story for the security guard, telling her that Devon is “one of Jame’s” and that nobody’s to know. Apparently creepy old Jame Eagan has many dalliances that are cleaned up using severance technology (among other means, no doubt). Mark S. wakes up in the cabin, understandably confused and disoriented. The episode ends with him spotting Cobel as she stands, looking rather diabolical, in front of the fireplace.\nInvestigator Irving And Burt Badman\nI realize that this first section covered most of the characters and bases from this second-to-last episode of Season 2. The only loose ends are Irving (John Turturro) and Burt, who Irving finds in his apartment, reading through his notes. Irving’s notes are curious, indeed. He’s been looking into several “disappearances” and possible “deaths” that Lumon has had a hand in, and a Mr. Burt Goodman is potentially one of Lumon’s “goons.” Burt finds this wording rather hurtful. “Lumon,” he says, “is very specific with its language.”\nLater, as they go on a drive that Burt insists upon, he tells Irving that he never hurt anybody. He was just a driver. He didn’t ask questions. It’s all very mafia-esque, but then Lumon is one part corporate entity, one part cult and one part criminal organization. Burt clearly did get his hands dirty even if he didn’t do any of the hurting personally, and this is why he decided to sever. He wanted to feel like a part of him could still be innocent. It’s not quite the same yarn he spun at dinner with Fields about Jesus and forgiveness and all the rest, but who knows if any of that was even real to begin with.\nIrving takes Burt to a train station and tells him he needs to go. He needs to get on a train and not let Burt know where he’s going and never, ever come back to Kier. It’s pretty obvious at this point that if he does, Lumon won’t let him live. “They’ll come after you,” Irving says to Burt. Burt brushes it off. “I’ve never been loved,” Irving tells him. Never in his entire life, until Burt G on the severed floor. He wants to experience that. “I’m ready,” he says. Burt tells him no, they can’t. But Irving keeps repeating it, over and over. Burt isn’t swayed. There is no sweet moment, no outie kiss. Irving and his old dog board a train and off they go. Burt sits in the station, looking old and tired and sad.\nAnd now we have just one more week to go before the end of Season 2 and whatever insane cliffhangers they leave us with.\nThis was a really strong episode and I’m glad we’re back to the main cast and Lumon and back on track after two weeks of side stories. It’s good to see Dylan and Irving and Helly and even Milchick again after a few weeks delving down other storylines. Of course, this was largely a setup episode, laying all the pieces out so that we can knock it all down in the season finale titled, naturally, Cold Harbor. What will happen next week? Mark’s innie and outie are set to have a conversation, though he’s also partly reintegrated. Dylan has resigned. Helly is facing her creepy outie’s dad. Milchick seems hellbent on continuing his mission for Lumon, but he’s clearly also having a crisis of faith. And what will Cobel do? Mark is right when he says they can’t trust her. Is she going to double-cross them in the end?\nMuch to ponder! I’ll be sad when the season is over and we have to wait another couple years for Season 3.\nLet me know your thoughts on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.

        "text": "Following Minnesota’s 72-64 loss to Northwestern Wednesday in the Big Ten Tournament, Minnesota has fired coach Ben Johnson.\nJohnson, 44, went 56-71 in four seasons at the Big Ten school, never finishing higher than ninth in the league. He replaced Richard Pitino in 2021 and it was his first head coaching job after assistant coaching stints at Northern Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Xavier.\nAmong possible replacements are Niko Medved of Colorado State and Ryan Saunders, a Minnesota native and Denver Nuggets assistant who played at Minnesota. Both are Minnesota natives with ties to the school.\n“I met with Ben in-person early this morning when the team returned to Minneapolis from the Big Ten Men’s Basketball Tournament and informed him that we were making a change in leadership,\" Minnesota AD Mark Coyle said in a statement. \"I thanked him for his dedication and for guiding the program, one he cares deeply about, for the last four years. Ben is a terrific person, and we wish him well.\n\"These decisions are difficult and are made after careful consideration and evaluation. The expectation for our program is to compete for championships, and unfortunately, we have not done that in the last four years.\n\"This is an extremely desirable job in one of the best conferences and cities in the nation, and we fully expect to compete at the highest level on and off the court. We provide a world-class experience for our student-athletes, have one of the best practice facilities in the nation and play games in a historic venue. We offer everything that is needed to be successful, and we will immediately begin a nationwide search for our next men's basketball coach.\"",

        "text": "Several of Tim Burton’s collaborators including Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Danny Elfman and Michael Keaton are interviewed in the first two episodes of director Tara Wood’s upcoming four-part Tim Burton Docuseries.\nWood granted me an exclusive first look at the first two episodes of the four-episode docuseries, which she recently finished in its entirety. The first episode was unveiled at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in June, and the contents of the second episode had not been seen until Wood gave me exclusive access to both chapters of the in-depth docuseries about Burton’s life and career.\nIn total, all four parts of the docuseries chronicle everything from Burton’s life growing up in Burbank, Calif. — which shows never-before-seen photos from his youth and some of his early home movie productions — all the way to the release of the 2024 supernatural comedy blockbuster Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\nIn a pair of recent Zoom conversations, Wood discussed the process of making the documentary, which began sort of the same way that a young Burton got screen legend Vincent Price to do the narration for his stop-motion animated short film classic Vincent over four decades ago.\n“I sent a handwritten note to Tim to ask for his permission to do his documentary,” Wood recalled. “I explained that we wouldn’t interview him but were going to interview his friends and it started there.”\nGiven the importance Burton had to their careers, it didn’t take long for the likes of Depp, Ryder and Keaton to agree to interviews, as well as Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Walken, Christoph Walz and Jenna Ortega.\nThe docuseries also delves into Burton’s collaborative partnerships with such creatives as composer Elfman, production designer Rich Heinrichs and producer Denise Di Novi — who reveals how she and Tim Burton met with several major film stars to play the title character in Edward Scissorhands.\nThe chemistry with the A-listers, however, simply wasn’t there, Di Novi explains in the docuseries: “We knew they really didn’t connect to the character in the way we wanted and we were starting to despair a little bit.”\nThat all changed, however, when Burton’s Beetlejuice star had a revelation.\n“Winona Ryder brought up Johnny. He wasn’t a movie star. He was the miserable TV star,” Di Novi says of Depp’s waning interest in his detective series 21 Jump Street.\n“In all honesty, I was probably doing my best in the last two years [of 21 Jump Street] just to get fired,” Depp recalls in the docuseries. “Suddenly, I was pigeonholed so I knew I had to fight it. I knew how important the choice of Crybaby with John Waters was, which gave me the opportunity to make fun of this arena I’d been placed in. So, that was for me my first solid step in the direction I wanted to go.”\nThe next solid step, however, made an indelible impression in the Hollywood landscape that reverberates to this day.\n“My agent sets up this meeting with Tim Burton after Crybaby and I was sent the screenplay for Edward Scissorhands,” Depp recalls in the docuseries. “What I felt from reading that screenplay was … it had passed through everything, anything solid and went to the very core of whatever I am. The writing was beautiful. The character was beautiful. What I suppose attacked me emotionally was that Edward was me … it’s exactly what I should be doing.”\nAlthough Burton is seen and heard in archived footage, Wood’s decision not to interview Burton is a normal part of her documentary filmmaking process. Prior to filming the Tim Burton Docuseries, Wood directed the 2014 feature 21 Years: Richard Linklater and 2019’s QT: The First Eight, which chronicled the first 21 years of Quentin Tarantino’s career.\n“This is my third doc, and I don't interview the subject because it allows them to be more open to the idea and to say yes [to the project] if they don't really like to talk about themselves,” Wood explained. “Quentin Tarantino is a really good example because everybody thinks Quentin likes to talk about himself, but he doesn’t. He told me, ‘I love this and I'm giving you the okay because I hate talking about myself’ … so it allows a different conversation and vibe.”\nSo, while Burton was not interviewed for the docuseries, Wood said he’s still very much a part of it.\n“Not being interviewed really allowed Tim to be involved comfortably,” Wood noted. “It's been a very free and organic process.”\nThe Tim Burton Docuseries Originated As A Documentary Feature\nTara Wood said she started work on her Tim Burton project in February 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic soon put the production on hold.\nWood said that she first intended to make a documentary feature film on Burton, much like she did on Richard Linklater and Quentin Tarantino. However, since the pandemic sidelined Wood’s documentary for a year, she had more time for research and as such, fleshed out the focus of Burton’s story.\n“The good side of it was, I had no idea about the depth of his artwork … so I started digging into that and learned a lot more about things like his love of dogs and it just blew up from there,” Wood recalled. “So that year gave me a lot of time to discover new things … The more I started to learn about Tim, it had to grow. I started it as a two-hour film and the bigger it got. Then it went to three and eventually four hours.”\nIn addition to Denise Di Novi, Wood interviewed Burton’s longtime costume designer Colleen Atwood for the docuseries, as well as Allison Abbate, who collaborated with the director on his stop-motion animation features.\nOther featured interviews include Tim Burton Exhibitions curator Jenny He and Derek Frey — Burton’s assistant-turned-producer who began working with the filmmaker on Mars Attacks! in 1996 and continued through 2019’s Dumbo.\n“Derek has been my rock,” Wood enthused. “Documentaries take such a long time as you're waiting for other people's schedules to fall into sync and it gets difficult sometimes. Derek, though, was always available to help. He's like an encyclopedia. Both Derek and Jenny. He was so helpful — they know everything.”\nWhat Is The Focus Of Parts 1 And 2 Of The Tim Burton Docuseries?\nMuch like the auteur’s work, Tara Wood’s Tim Burton Docuseries is engaging from the get-go in Episode 1, from the flurry of fascinating stories from the actors in Burton’s troupe to the presentation of Burton’s immense catalogue of artwork by Jenny He.\nDanny Elfman even helps set the tone in the opening credits with an original composition for the docuseries’ theme.\nEpisode 1 takes a deep dive into Burton’s childhood and his origin as a filmmaker, where Wood exhibits clips from many of his early home movie productions as a teenager and short films as an animation student at CalArts.\nIn addition, Burton’s work as a Disney animator and his short films at the studio — Vincent and the live-action version of Frankenweenie — are chronicled, as are his feature films Peewee’s Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Batman.\nEpisode 2, meanwhile, takes an in-depth look at Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman Returns and Ed Wood.\nLargely present throughout the first two episodes of Wood’s Tim Burton Docuseries is how the theme of being an outsider is pivotal to each one of Burton’s films. As such, it’s interesting to learn that beneath the surface of Burton’s classic superhero movie — 1989’s Batman — the theme of being an outsider (and the isolation and loneliness that goes with it) exists just as much in Batman as it does in any of his other films.\n“Tim Burton didn’t actually grow up reading comic books. He wasn’t this comic book nerd,” Jenny He notes in the section about Burton’s first Batman film. “But what he identified with was the loneliness of having to put on a mask … of not being able to reveal your true identity.”\nThe theme of isolation and loneliness certainly wasn’t lost on Batman star Michael Keaton.\n“It was never really about Batman. It was about Bruce Wayne,” Keaton says in the docuseries. “That was always the trick. That was the key … that, ‘Who was Bruce Wayne?’ You know, a guy who found a way to do what he had to do because he had to do it, but at the same time he probably thought his life was really unusual. When you feel like that, you probably feel lonely.”\nYou can watch He and Keaton discuss the lonely aspect of Burton, Batman and Bruce Wayne in the exclusive video clip below.\nThe Tim Burton Docuseries Encourages Viewers To Hold On To Their Identities\nWhile the first two parts of Tara Wood’s Tim Burton Docuseries dive into Burton’s films, the celebration of his work — and the encouragement it has provided to fans — is the overarching theme of episodes 1 and 2 (and undoubtedly 3 and 4).\n“He encourages everyone to ‘Hey, hold on to your identity because that’s all you really have,’ He says in the docuseries. “Tim has said this, ‘Whether you are a costume designer, whether you’re a musician, whether you’re a filmmaker. Whether you’re a book writer or screenplay writer. No matter what form your creative expression takes, just keep doing it because it’s really about holding onto self.”\nIn perhaps a bit of Kismet, Wood said the theme even awakened a part of her that was lost along the way on the path of the thing we call life.\n“Here's what Tim taught me — I didn't know I was an artist,” Wood said. “I forgot that I wanted to be a Disney animator. In his films, Tim talks about not losing that childlike stuff. He talks about being yourself and not getting lost. I realized that I was one of the kids that got lost.”\nBut after seeing the first two parts of the four-part Tim Burton Docuseries, there’s no doubt that Wood found herself again.\n“Imagine the strength it takes to hold on to yourself? It's hard … but Tim, did it, Johnny did it, Winona did it, Danny Elfman did it and Rick Heinrichs did it — and they all found each other,” Wood said.\n“People have asked me, ‘What did you take away from this experience?’” Wood added. “My feelings are, ‘What would it be like to have that superpower? How did Tim find these people in his life and bring them all together? How the frick did you find all those people at that young age? And they’re still together and have been with him his entire life — and they’re all geniuses. How do you do that?’”\nDirector Tara Wood’s yet-to-be officially titled four-part Tim Burton Docuseries is still awaiting a release date.

        "text": "Novacaine — a new action comedy starring Jack Quaid, Amber Midthunder and Jacob Batalon — is new in theaters Are critics groaning or laughing at the pain-filled movie?\nRated R, Novocaine opens in theaters nationwide on Friday. The logline for Novocaine reads, “When the girl of his dreams is kidnapped, a man incapable of feeling physical pain turns his rare condition into an unexpected advantage in the fight to rescue her.”\nQuaid (The Boys) plays Nate Caine in Novocaine, an assistant bank manager in San Diego who springs into action when three bank robbers dressed as Santa Claus rob his bank and take his girlfriend, Sherry (Midthunder, Prey) hostage.\nBatalon (Spider-Man: No Way Home) stars as Roscoe, Nate’s video game-playing partner, while Ray Nicholson (Smile 2) plays Simon, the mastermind behind the bank heist.\nDirected by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, Novocaine also stars Betty Gabriel, Matt Walsh, Lou Beatty Jr., Van Hengst and Conrad Kemp.\nAs of Thursday, Rotten Tomatoes critics have collectively given Novocaine an 80% “fresh” rating based on 94 reviews. The RT Critics Consensus for the film reads, “Getting an adrenaline shot from Jack Quaid and Amber Midthunder's considerable charm while finding increasingly demented ways to utilize its concept, Novocaine is the opposite of a pain to watch.”\nWhat Are Individual Critics Saying About ‘Novocaine’?\nBrandon Yu is among the top critics on RT who gives Novocaine a “fresh” review, writing in his review for the New York Times, “What keeps it from deflating into tiresome shtick (which it very nearly does) is [Jack] Quaid with his gawky, boyish charisma, an actual tough guy who just doesn’t know how to act it.”\nKyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal also gives Novocaine a “fresh” review on RT, writing, “The almost nonstop fighting and Mr. Quaid’s low-key charm are enough to make the movie a serviceable action offering. Moreover, the script, though focused on wacky spasms of violence, has a strong human element at its core.”\nWilliam Bibbiani of The Wrap also praises the lead of Novocaine for the film’s success. Bibbiani writes in his review on RT, “Jack Quaid was born for a role like this. The actor’s unassuming cheerfulness provides the perfect comedic counterpoint to the film’s increasingly absurd gross-out action gags.”\nOdie Henderson of the Boston Globe is among the top critics on RT who give Novocaine a “rotten” review, writing, “It’s like watching the Black Knight get dismembered in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, except that was funny and the gag didn’t run nearly two hours. To my surprise, I was bored by the gruesome and repetitive carnage.”\nAlso among Novocaine’s detractors is Nick Schager of The Daily Beast, who writes in his RT summary, “In trying to have it both ways, it succeeds in neither, in the process stranding its charming leading man in a saga that needed to be either goofier or more gruesome.”\nJen Yamato of the Washington Post also gave Novocaine a “rotten” review on RT, writing, “Novocaine lives up to its name, all right — a tedious action-comedy so numbingly bland, you feel the pain of its 110-minute run time even as its protagonist can’t feel a thing.”\nNovcaine opens in theaters nationwide on Friday.",

        "text": "The Lego Group built itself into one of the largest toy companies in the world brick-by-brick. Now, two major U.S. toy companies are launching new brands of bricks in hopes of capturing some of Lego’s lucrative market share in the construction toy category.\nWhile Lego’s place at the pinnacle of the construction category is quite secure, even a small slice of its market share could be a big boost a toymaker’s bottom line. Lego reported 2024 revenue of over $10 billion, and its consumer sales were up 12%, while overall sales across the toy industry were down slightly.\nAt New York Toy Fair two weeks ago, Lego showcased its largest-ever product portfolio, including the new Lego Bluey licensed partnership, and wowed fair attendees by creating a garden setting for its exhibit, with large floral displays from its Botanicals Collection.\nRoom In Bricks Category For New Players\nWhile toymakers previously have tried, mostly without success, to steal share from Lego, Lego’s strong growth in a tough year for toys has signaled there may be room in the category for new players.\n“Of course they’re not taking on Lego - that would be a fool’s errand. But what Lego has demonstrated has been the appetite for construction toys in the collector and kidult market,” Chris Byrne, an independent toy consultant known as The Toy Guy, and author of “Toy Time”, a history of hit toys, said in an interview.\n“They’re going to continue to be the dominant player in that category, but that doesn’t mean there’s not opportunities,” Byrne said.\nIn January, U.S. toy manufacturers, Mattel and Jazwares shared the news that they are launching brick-based construction sets.\nMattel’s new brand, Mattel Brick Shop, was announced at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair, but no other details are being made public until the first product in the new line is released in May. At the New York Toy Fair at the beginning of this month, Mattel had a case filled with plastic bricks bearing the logo Mattel Brick Shop at its exhibit, but no examples of products. The buzz from insiders at the show, however, was that new new brick products will be “brilliant.”\nJazwares creates a signature “SquishBrik”\nJazwares, the company known for the blockbuster toy hit of the past decade, the Squishmallows plush toys, began rolling out its new construction toy brand, BLDR, in January. Jazwares has come up with creative ways to create construction sets featuring toy properties including Hello Kitty and Friends, figures from popular online anime series Crunchyroll, and playsets inspired by its Squishmallows plush, which include a special “SquishBrik”.\nBoth companies said they decided to launch their new construction brands because they saw an opportunity in the market to capture a niche and meet a demand by consumers.\nNot only is the construction category “one of the highest dollar volume supercategories of toys globally,” it is ”dominated by an industry giant, and subject to opportunistic, savvy, innovative new participants with phenomenal licensing relationships,\" Jeremy Padawer, Chief Brand Officer at Jazwares, said via email.\n“Jazwares’ decision to enter the construction category was born out of this insight, that we could serve the unmet needs of builders with a fresh, innovative new approach,” Padawer said.\nIn developing BLDR, he said, “we put the license and IP at the center of the building experience and developed concepts around the unique DNA of each.”\nFor the Squishmallows sets, they wanted to incorporate something “squishy” and created figures with a SquishBrik that gives the character a soft, rounded, and squishable belly.\nTiltable Heads For Hello Kitty Figures\nWith the Hello Kitty and Friends figures, “we leveraged the cute and iconic elements” of that property, Padawer said. “For instance, our minifugures have a special balljoint feature that allows them to tilt their heads - making them even cuter and more articulate,” he said.\nFor the Crunchyroll anime property, they created buildable 9-inch action figures using their QuikBrik design, which allows for a stronger build that also is easy to customize.\nThe first batch of BLDR sets were available at Target and Amazon starting in January, with wider retail distribution this spring. Prices of playsets and action figures range from $9.99 to $29.99, with minifigure sets starting at $2.99.\nMattel Seeks to Disrupt Bricks Status Quo\nMattel, when it announced the Mattel Brick Shop brand, said it is “designed to disrupt the status quo, bending the rules of building with innovative features, materials and techniques that inspire builders to try something new.”\nThe press release about the launch emphasized that Mattel is aiming to offer a quality building experience at an affordable price, implying that it is targeting those consumers who covet the elaborate building sets Lego is known for, but want that experience at a lower price.\nMattel says it will be offering “a quality brick fit, easy to follow playbooks,” and “more post-build opportunities like customization and more piece count, all at a competitive price.”\nMattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, during the company’s earnings call in February, called Mattel Brick Shop an opportunity for Mattel to “leverage our capabilities between design, very strong supply chain, and a global commercial platform.”\n“We are leaning on the Mattel brand and leveraging the trust and relationship that fans have with Mattel,” Kreiz said.\nBuilding On Mega Foundation\nMattel has solid experience in the construction category. It acquired the Mega Brands company in 2014, and has built that brand, with its Mega Bloks, Mega Construx, and Mega Collector lines, into the second largest brand behind Lego.\n“Mattel’s Brick Shop is a reinvention of Mega Construx atop a foundation (Mattel’s) been building for years,\" James Zahn, Editor-in-Chief of The Toy Book and Senior Editor at The Toy Insider, said via email. “I think we’ll see a compelling offering that checks all the boxes when those first sets debut in May,” he said.\nWith its BLDR line, Zahn said, Jazwares has “wisely leaned into their own IP, like Squishmallows, and they’re getting sets into specialty retailers like Hot Topic. ”If you look at their anime offerings, like the Chainsaw man set, its construction and an articulated action figure at an affordable price,\" he said.\nZahn noted that this isn’t the first time that toymakers have tried to grab some of Lego’s magic and market share.\nIn the 1980s, he said, the Tyco toy company “famously placed a full-page ad in The Toy Book with bold , black text in all caps: TYCO DECLARES WAR ON LEGO. It didn’t end well for them,” Zahn said.\nHasbro also made two attempts to innovate in the construction space before deciding to concentrate on licensing its IP to Lego and Mattel for their brick sets, Zahn noted.\n“There is a lot of appeal for toymakers to get into the building and construction category because they see a whitespace for a challenger in an aisle traditionally dominated by two companies over the past 40 years - Lego and Mega,” Zahn said.\n“A competitive advantage that the Lego Group has always maintained is extreme precision,” Zahn said. “Challengers couldn’t nail a Lego brick’s perfect fit no matter how hard they tried. Now, they’re getting close, but it’s up to the consumer to decide, - and all brands have fans,” he said.\n“The biggest opportunity in this space,” Zahn said, “is to offer excellent products at a great value. Lego sets can be very expensive, which puts them out of reach for many kids and families who would love the opportunity to build them,\" he said, noting that the high price has led to an uptick in knockoffs and bootlegs. “I’m curious if the opening of the new Lego factory in Virginia will impact pricing in the U.S.,” he said.",

        "text": "Each Friday, I pick out North America’s celestial highlights for the weekend ahead (which also applies to northern hemisphere mid-northern latitudes). Check my main feed for more in-depth articles on stargazing, astronomy, eclipses and more.\nThe Night Sky This Weekend: March 14-16, 2025\nIn the wake of the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, there ought to be more sky-watchers than usual this weekend as the “blood moon” reminds everyone of the night sky’s spectacular sights. As well as another lunar highlight on Sunday, this is also your last chance to see Venus — and it’s looking absolutely stunning.\nFriday, March 14-Saturday, March 15: Venus As A Crescent\nJust after sunset, look low in the western sky to see the two innermost planets of the solar system — Venus and Mercury. Although seeing Mercury in the post-sunset sky is a rare opportunity, there’s something much more exciting to see tonight. Now just 3%-lit, Venus is on the cusp of disappearing into the sun’s glare. It will pass into the pre-dawn sky on March 22, but this weekend is the last good chance to easily see it — and what a sight. See through any telescope, or even a big pair of binoculars, the crescent looks like a smiley face and is so slim, and low in the sky, that is shines in all of the colors of the rainbow.\nAccording to Spaceweather.com, that’s because Earth’s atmosphere acts like a prism, separating the red crescent from the blue, with the splitting of colors so obvious because the crescent is so slim.\nCatch Venus and Mercury while you can before they both vanish into the twilight next week. Be outside 45 minutes after sunset and get observing because they’ll sink into the western horizon within about 30 minutes.\nSunday, March 16: Moon And Spica\nBe outside looking east-southeast about two hours after sunset to see a 93%-lit waning gibbous moon rise just below a bright star — Spica in the constellation Virgo. This star, which is 261 light-years from the solar system, is one of four that the moon passes close to every month. The others are Aldebaran, Regulus and Antares. However, this is a particularly close pass.\nThe sight of Spica rising in the east is a sign that astronomical spring is almost with us.\nThe times and dates given apply to mid-northern latitudes. For the most accurate location-specific information, consult online planetariums like Stellarium and use a sunrise and sunset calculator for where you are.\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes.",

        "text": "From living in apartments without dishwashers to just generally being precious about my knives and cookware, I’m somewhat of a hand-washing loyalist. Though I can’t dispute the convenience of letting an appliance take care of your dirty plates and silverware, through my years covering kitchen staples, I’ve come to believe that most things really shouldn’t be run through dishwasher if you want to maximize longevity. But do I, personally, enjoy the ritual of scrubbing off burnt pieces of vegetables from large sheet trays or washing the undersides of plates? Not one bit—but I’ve recently learned that dish spray makes the routine chore much less tedious.\nI first tried out the cleaner a few months ago, while staying at an Airbnb where dish spray—specifically, Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash—was the only solution on hand. As a longtime user of traditional bottled soap, I’d thought of the spray version as a gimmick that didn’t outperform the original in any way; it just cost more money. But dish spray has genuinely changed the game for me: Whereas it’s hard to manage how much soap you squeeze out with traditional bottles, dish spray dispenses a controlled amount, covering your plates and pans with a light mist that foams on contact and doesn’t require water. “The spray feature really conserves the amount of soap you use, so you can save money,\" says professional housekeeper Sara San Angelo, who has over two decades of experience and shares cleaning tips on her blog Confessions of a Cleaning Lady. “We’ve all dumped way too much dish soap on one dish with the regular bottles.\"\nBoosting its star power, Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash—which was the first dish spray to hit the market in 2020 and remains the most popular—is more effective than its bottled brethren, as its formula includes alcohols and other solvents that the original is lacking. (The brand also sells a Free & Clear version that’s made without dyes.) Just a single spray can cut through a thick layer of grease; even bright yellow turmeric stains have proven to be no match for the formula, and I’ve used the spray on some heavily discolored storage containers. What’s more, you can use the spray on more than just plates and cookware. San Angelo, for example, uses it to clean counters and spot treat laundry, as well.\nThough Dawn Powerwash remains my favorite dish spray, I’ve since tried out a few alternatives to see how they stack up. One such is a vinegar-based formula from 9 Elements, which is great for those seeking a more natural, gentler option. Sold in the exact same vessel as Powerwash, the dish spray has a pleasant lemon scent and the same continuous spray mechanism. I’ve also found it to be highly effective, though it doesn’t cut through film and oil quite as effortlessly as Dawn Powerwash. That said, it’s my favorite cleaner for my All-Clad stainless steel pans, as vinegar’s acidic properties make it especially great at erasing the rainbow sheen the cookware material sometimes takes on after being exposed to high heat.\nAnother spray that I’d recommend comes from Seventh Generation—specifically, its honeycrisp apple–scented formula, which is softer than your standard green apple fragrance. (If that doesn’t appeal to you, though, it’s also sold in a mandarin orange version, as well as unscented.) An EPA Safer Choice–certified product, this spray is made with biodegradable ingredients, making it a great eco-friendly alternative to Dawn Powerwash. While I’m not as big of a fan of this pick’s bottle, as each spray comes out with more force than necessary, I’ve used this formula (which comes out in an especially thick foam) to lift caked-on cheese, coffee stains and tomato sauce from dishes.\nOne more nice perk with all the sprays? With each one, you can buy refills if you want to hang onto your bottle, or you could even try your hand at making your own formula like San Angelo: “I keep my spray bottle for much longer, as I make my own solution and put it back in the spray bottle to save even more money.” While I like to think of myself as resourceful, I’m also lazy—which is precisely why dish sprays, with their dispensing mechanisms and fast-acting formulas, are such a game-changer.",

        "text": "After the timing crisis affecting March 8th SAT testers occurred, the College Board sent the following message to affected families:\nWe're reaching out because you were impacted by a technical issue that caused your March 8 SAT exam to be submitted automatically before your testing time was over. While this issue has been resolved for future tests, we know this was a frustrating and stressful experience for you, and we are sorry. You will receive a full refund of your registration fees for the March 8 test and a voucher for a free SAT registration for future administration. In the coming days, we'll also follow up with options for a March 22 makeup administration if your test center can offer one. As for your March 8 exam, you have two options: 1. If you want your score from this test canceled, you do not need to take any action. 2. If you have already completed your test when you saw the submission/\"Congratulations\" screen, you may choose to keep your score. We assure you that any questions answered before the test auto-submitted were fully captured and will be reflected in your score should you want to keep it. Please note that if you choose to keep your score, you must contact Customer Service by March 20 via the form at www.sat.org/inquiry and select the topic \"Scores,\" alternatively, you can call customer service at the number(s) listed below. Additionally, if you choose to keep your score, you will not be eligible for a March 22 makeup exam. Regardless of your choice, you will receive a full refund and voucher for free future registration. We will be in touch via email next week with information about processing full refunds, providing vouchers, and, if applicable, makeup testing.\"\nThe same message was sent to Forbes when asked for a comment.\nOn March 13th, the College Board sent the following to affected families: We know you were impacted by a technical issue during the March 8–9 weekend SAT® administration that ended your test before your testing time was complete. We understand this has been an incredibly frustrating situation for you after you worked hard to prepare for the test, and we apologize.\nThis email is an update to the email you received over the weekend about next steps and includes information about new options for you.\nYou don’t need to take any action right now, but here’s what happens next.\nBy the end of this week, we will issue a full refund of your registration fees to your original form of payment, and we will also apply a voucher to your account for a free registration for a future SAT administration.\nAlso, by the end of this week, you will receive an email with a preview of your score from your test. Previewing this score will allow you to make an informed decision about whether to keep your score or take a makeup exam if it’s available in your area on March 22 (March 23 for Sunday testers).\nBy March 19, you will receive an email letting you know if a makeup exam is available to you. If a makeup isn’t available, we will share information about your options.\nIf you decide to keep your score (by opting out of the March makeup exam), you will get your official score no later than March 26. If you instead take an available March 22 makeup exam, your March 8 score will be canceled, and you will receive your makeup score within two weeks.\nAgain, we understand this issue has created a very difficult situation for you, and we are sorry.\nIf you have any questions, you may contact Customer Service at www.sat.org/inquiry or 866-756-7346, or +1-212-713-7789 (international). Customer Service hours are 8 a.m.–8 p.m. ET, Monday–Friday.\nJi Gilbreth, a parent of a junior, found this response inadequate. \"If the student wants to keep the R/W part, it is unclear if they will score the math section and how they will address on the score report that the student didn’t get to complete that section. They still do not acknowledge the fact that March 22 may not work and if it doesn’t, the student will have to wait til the May or June exam when AP exams, final exams are going on and the student might be rusty with SAT or have to prioritize SAT prep again over school work, AP tests, end of year sports tournaments, concerts/recitals, etc. They need to offer multiple dates for the retake, preferably in the month of March\nAs a parent, I strongly feel that College Board should:\n-let the students keep the March 8th R/W score and if the student didn’t finish the math section, do not score the math section (and they need to put a big asterisk that there is no math score due to a technology issue by the College Board)\n-AND they should let students ALSO take the March 22nd or whatever makeup date(s) offered since the student didn’t get to take the math portion at no fault of their own.\"\nAdam Ingersoll, who originally broke this story, is pleased with this decision. “College Board has improved the remedy initially offered to students affected by the March 8 timing glitch. Most importantly, students will NOT have to cancel their scores blind in order to have a shot at the May 22 retake possibility. CB has created a special process to let students preview their scores before making that decision. And, while it could be more explicit, the message belows seems to make clear that cancellation will NOT be the default; rather March 8 scores will stand unless proactively cancelled by the student.”\nHe wonders whether students who already cancelled their scores will be able to retract this decision. He has reached out to the College Board for a response.\nThis was a massive error of the College Board’s own making and their initial response was panned as inadequate by parents, students and the college admissions community. It is a good sign that they are adjusting their response to better meet the needs of students and families.",

        "text": "Duke superstar Cooper Flagg may be a bit more athletic than former All-Star forward Gordon Hayward, but they both have something in common – they know what its like to be the centerpiece of a National Championship-contending team.\nAlthough Hayward carved out a 14-year NBA career that included an All-Star appearance, he’s best known to a lot of basketball fans for leading the Butler Bulldogs to a National Championship Game appearance in 2010, where they came up just short of defeating the Duke Blue Devils. Hayward missed the game-winning buzzer-beating half-court shot in his final collegiate game.\nJust prior to Flagg’s ACC Tournament debut against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets – he exited the game and didn’t return due to an ankle sprain – Hayward spoke glowingly of the “phenomenal” talent that Flagg is. The 6-foot-9 18-year-old is projected to be the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.\n“He’s a phenomenal talent, a phenomenal player,” says Hayward in a one-on-one interview of Flagg. “Something that's really impressive to me about him is most of the guys in the same realm as him, it's usually a lot about scoring. To me, one of the best parts about his game is just his winning mentality, his competitive spirit.”\nHayward goes into detail, saying that Flagg brings more to the court than just scoring – he impacts the game in multiple aspects to help his team win. The freshman is averaging 19.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. In other words, he’s impacting the game in literally every way for the No. 1-ranked Blue Devils.\n“He does so many things out in the court to help the team win,” says Hayward. “You can’t teach size and the length and his motor. I think his motor is also really impressive. He plays super hard when he’s out there on the court and sometimes guys that are that talented don’t usually have that type of a motor. I think it’s really impressive for him to have that at such a young age.”\nGordon Haywward on Cooper Flagg’s NBA Fit: ‘He Fits Into Just About Any Team’\nFlagg is notable not just because of the type of basketball prospect that he is, but because he’s essentially a lock to be picked No. 1 overall. That’s notable because Hayward’s former teams, the Utah Jazz and the Charlotte Hornets, have a legitimate chance at earning the top pick in the draft due to their lowly records. The Jazz and the Hornets are tied with the Washington Wizards as far as projection odds of landing the top pick.\nWhen asked how Flagg would fit in with either one of his former teams, Hayward says he could “fit” in to just about anywhere due to his versatile skill set.\n“He’s one of those guys because of all the things I just said, he’s one of those guys that fits into just about any team,” says Hayward. “He's pretty versatile. He could mold himself into whatever role the team that he goes to needs him to play. That's a credit to him and his work ethic and certainly I think he'll become a better shooter. Every team would be happy to have him. That's why so many teams are doing what they're doing in the NBA to try to get him.”\nHayward – who is 6-foot-7 and known more for his scoring, shooting and offensive skill set – says he would actually compare Flagg to himself when it comes to an NBA player comparison. He mentions that the comparison comes from a motor and “versatility” standpoint.\n“This might be a hot take, but I said this from the beginning, I think he plays a lot like I play,” says Hayward of Flagg. “I see a lot of myself in him. I just think that he’s two or three inches taller and more athletic, longer. But I played very similar to him. I feel like I was a very versatile player, doing a lot of different things for the team.”\nThe 34-year-old – who retired after last season – says he can also see the Larry Bird comparisons in Flagg. Flagg and Bird are both the same height at 6-foot-9, and Bird was definitely known for his versatility. However, the Boston Celtics legend’s athleticism doesn’t compare to Flagg and Bird was never a shot blocker like the 6-foot-9 phenom is.\n“The Larry (Bird) comparisons are probably a little bit accurate as well, just because of his height and his ability to do so many different things on like Larry did too,” says Hayward. “But I feel like there was a lot I saw out of my game in him.”\nGordon Hayward Partners With Colgate For ‘Total Active Prevention System’\nHayward is speaking on behalf of his partnership with Colgate for their \"Colgate Total Active Prevention System.” Colgate is also the official oral partner of the Big East conference, with Hayward being honored as a conference legend – he played at Butler, which is now part of the Big East conference – during the start of the tournament prior to Butler’s game against St. Johns.\nThe “Colgate Total Active Prevention System” features a different toothpaste, a “state-of-the-art” toothbrush and mouthwash to prevent gingivitis and cavities.\n”It is something where as an athlete, I’m very used to doing stuff to prevent future health problems — called prehab — and Colgate is doing something very similar with the system that they have,” Hayward details. “It’s going to help prevent all of those problems. They have a new toothpaste, toothbrush and mouthwash. As a father, it’s something I’m trying to do, to actively get my kids to brush their teeth.”\nThe former All-Star details why the partnership is important to him, especially with people that are concerned about their “wellness.”\n“I just want to encourage people,” says Hayward. “Everybody’s into wellness. Everyone’s in to taking care of themselves as they should be, and that shouldn’t stop with your mouth. You gotta take care of your teeth and your mouth and your gums and to help, we’ve come up with the active prevention system.”",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, Marco Asensio perhaps didn’t know he needed Aston Villa. For the Premier League club, attracting a big name who has since been the perfect tonic was a dream scenario. Yet here we are: Asensio loves Villa, and Villa loves him.\nOnce a serial champion with Real Madrid, the Spaniard, half of whose family is Dutch, has netted seven goals in his last five matches across all competitions after joining the team on loan from Paris Saint-Germain in February. In just 71 minutes over two legs against Club Brugge, he scored three times as a resurgent Villa made the Champions League quarterfinals. Notable is Asensio’s instant chemistry with another loanee, Marcus Rashford, in the offensive third of the field.\nBorn in Mallorca, Asensio went on to make his career at Real. While not the biggest star at Los Blancos, he spent nearly a decade there—only interrupted by early spells at Mallorca and Espanyol—as a dependable number 10, and he was on the scoresheet in Real’s 12th European Cup win over Juventus in 2017. Unable to stand out from the crowd of dynamos in Paris, he’s now relishing the role of attacking midfielder, even auxiliary forward, with the Villans. At 29, he’s still got a lot to offer.\n“How he’s connecting with other players, keeping ball possession, and getting (into) good positions is really important for us,’’ head coach Unai Emery has said of Asensio. “His skills, more or less, are in my idea structurally and tactically, in how I want to build the team here. One player like him is very important.’’ His loan is without a buy option, but Villa may explore a permanent deal; Asensio’s salary will likely be steep, but not necessarily his price tag, which Villa could afford while competing in the most prestigious tournaments.\nVilla Is A Different Beast With Asensio\nHighly-rated Asensio’s form typifies Villa’s growing status as an elite club. Of course, it’s always been a force in English soccer and has pedigree abroad after winning Europe’s most prestigious trophy in 1982. Yet this is the first time Villa has reached the event’s quarterfinal stage since a year later in 1983. Its transfer policy and business, drafting in enviable players such as Asensio, Rashford, and Donyell Malen, show the way ahead.\nA lot is down to Emery. The Basque boss has spoken about consolidating Villa’s place in European competitions, and despite considerable investment in the squad, he’s dragged the side into the elite bracket. Whereas Villa was initially chasing the best, it’s arguably one of them now: Asensio’s impact may catch the eye of more prospective signings, able to compete at the top with history, ambition, and raucous home support behind them. It’s a ripple effect.\nThe sternest test of Villa’s credentials arrives in the next round of the Champions League. And, yes, it’s against PSG. Thankfully for the underdog, Asensio’s switch didn’t include a claúsula de miedo, or fear clause as the Spanish press call it, meaning the sharpshooter will be eligible to face his French employer. It would be the ultimate irony for PSG, littered with quality and a candidate to win its first big-eared trophy, to get undone by one of its dropouts.\nAlthough progression to the semifinals will depend on how the whole squad performs, Asensio, the playmaker with a winning mentality (having won 17 titles in Madrid) and not yet 100% primed in Emery’s eyes, is poised to make a telling difference. Asensio might be the ace in the pack during what’s left of the 2024/25 campaign.",

        "text": "Recently, escalating economic tensions between Canada and the United States, prominently intensified under President Donald Trump’s administration, have consistently featured retaliatory tariffs as the primary political instrument. While these measures might garner immediate political visibility, their effectiveness as sustainable economic strategies remains highly questionable. While the desire to see Canadians unite with a strong, collective voice against tariffs is understandable, it is crucial to carefully examine the long-term economic and societal consequences of such measures. Emphasizing the importance of rational, evidence-based analysis over emotional or symbolic responses is essential to safeguarding Canada's economic resilience and strength.\nHistorically and economically, retaliatory tariffs rarely yield their intended political and economic objectives. The United States, wielding significant economic leverage, remains relatively insulated from Canadian countermeasures. Indeed, the asymmetry in economic dependency between the two countries is glaring. In 2023, Canada’s domestic merchandise exports to the U.S. reached approximately $548 billion, representing nearly 77% of Canada’s overall exports. Among these exports, energy products ($166 billion) and motor vehicles and parts ($82 billion) were the largest categories, together accounting for over 40% of Canada’s total exports to the United States. Although Canada is traditionally the top U.S. export market, it only accounts for 14.2% of all U.S. goods exports. Such trade imbalance ensures Canada suffers disproportionately in economic confrontations.\nThe renewable energy sector, especially in the manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, relies heavily on cross-border supply chains. A trade dispute can disrupt the flow of goods and materials, affecting both countries’ ability to secure critical minerals needed for clean energy development. As renewable energy technologies are integrated into energy grids across North America, price hikes and delays caused by tariffs may slow the implementation of climate initiatives, including efforts to reduce carbon emissions in line with Canada’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nIn addition, many Canadian companies work closely with U.S.-based firms on research and development initiatives related to energy storage, smart grids, and clean tech innovations. The uncertainty created by trade disputes can make it harder for firms in both countries to collaborate effectively, thereby slowing the pace of technological advancement. The imposition of tariffs on clean technologies and R&D partnerships could also lead to a brain drain with skilled workers in the renewable energy and climate tech sectors seeking opportunities in other regions with more stable business environments.\nAmid escalating trade tensions, Ontario Premier recently suggested imposing retaliatory tariffs on electricity exports to the United States, aiming to make a strong political statement against perceived unfair U.S. trade practices. While such a proposal might resonate politically, economically it is counterproductive. In 2023, Ontario’s exports amounted to $226 billion, accounting for over one-fifth of the province’s economy. More than 75% of Ontario’s international trade is conducted with the United States, which represents 39% of the province’s economy. Implementing tariffs on electricity would cost Americans between $66 million and $165 million annually. The proposed electricity export tariff would potentially jeopardize this critical revenue stream, potentially prompting U.S. states to seek cheaper alternatives and damaging Ontario’s credibility as a reliable energy provider. Moreover, Ontario’s electricity grid frequently produces surplus power; export markets are essential to avoid costly waste or curtailment. Implementing prolonged retaliatory tariffs would ultimately harm Ontario’s own economic interests, driving up domestic electricity costs and undermining the province’s economic competitiveness. Retaliatory tariffs typically harm the imposing nation far more than the intended target, often leading to unintended economic consequences and escalating tensions without prompting policy reversals. Ontario’s electricity export tariff proposal exemplifies precisely this flawed logic, sacrificing long-term economic stability for short-term political optics.\nIt could be argued that imposing retaliatory tariffs on electricity exports might encourage American states to seek more cost-effective energy alternatives, particularly those based on fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Indeed, recent market developments highlight this risk clearly. Last week Natural gas futures prices in the U.S. surged to their highest levels in two years before easing slightly, following Canada’s announcement of a proposed electricity export tax demonstrating the market signal to the increased demand. Such a transition to fossil fuel-based electricity generation, including coal and natural gas power plants, would significantly elevate regional carbon emissions and air pollution, undermining decades of joint Canada-U.S. environmental initiatives aimed at sustainability, pollution reduction, and climate change mitigation.\nRetaliatory Tariffs and Economic Uncertainty Amplifying Housing Challenges\nThe housing market is deeply entangled within broader economic patterns, a reflection of collective confidence in the future and Canada’s capacity to maintain meaningful employment. When macroeconomic uncertainties such as job losses, financial instability, and shifting immigration policies enter the equation, they manifest as diminished trust and a retreat from market participation. The Canadian government’s recent decision to scale down immigration targets between 2025 and 2027 adds an additional layer of complexity, potentially further reducing housing demand, especially within major urban centers where affordability pressures are already severe.\nIn contemplating possible futures, Canada is facing two distinct scenarios, each with profound implications. Consider the scenario of deeper economic stagnation: a prolonged downturn could significantly delay the recovery of the housing sector, exacerbating affordability struggles, and suppressing new residential construction. On the opposite pole, a more optimistic scenario emerges if economic fundamentals strengthen, mortgage rates decline, and immigration policies stabilize. In this scenario, demand would quickly rebound, driving prices upward yet again. Nonetheless, even under these more favorable conditions, affordability issues would persist, particularly pronounced in densely populated provinces like Ontario and British Columbia.\nIn both scenarios, retaliatory tariffs pose serious risks to Canada's housing sector. While tariffs imposed by the U.S. might temporarily lower domestic prices for materials typically exported southward, the downstream impacts are profound. Canadian manufacturers, already stretched thin, could struggle to maintain viability, resulting in permanent closures and lost capacity. The Canadian lumber industry serves as a particularly concerning example: tariffs limiting lumber exports risk permanently closing mills, diminishing domestic production capacity, and increasing construction costs in the long run.\nAdding to these concerns, Canada's targeted tariffs on U.S. goods such as major household appliances will inevitably ripple through residential supply chains, increasing prices for vital construction materials. Canada imports substantial volumes of residential construction essentials from the U.S., including appliances, ceramic tiles, lumber products, and more. Importers will thus face significant challenges, prompting Canadian businesses to seek alternative domestic or international suppliers. While this shift could beneficially stimulate domestic production and enhance economic resilience in the long run, in the short-term it translates into higher costs, uncertainty, and delayed projects.\nMoreover, beneath these broad economic scenarios lies a nuanced reality. Developers, particularly in the condominium sector, face increasing uncertainty and diminishing profitability, causing hesitation and delay. According to CMHC, condo construction is expected to decrease markedly over the next three years, although overall housing starts will remain above their 10-year average. This tension between immediate market realities and long-term housing needs highlights a deeper complexity embedded in Canada’s economic structures.\nUltimately, the decision to impose retaliatory tariffs presents an opportunity to rethink and strengthen Canada’s economic strategy. Rather than focusing on symbolic political gestures, Canada can embrace transformative solutions: diversifying international trade partnerships, streamlining regulatory processes, and investing in domestic innovation and production capabilities. By addressing these deeper structural challenges, Canada has the potential to build a robust, resilient housing market and pave the way for a stronger, more sustainable economic future.\nTariffs Revenue: Lost in Bureaucratic Inefficiencies\nAn often overlooked aspect of retaliatory tariffs is how collected revenues are managed by governments. While tariffs generate significant income for government coffers, these additional funds rarely translate into tangible economic or public benefits. Instead, tariff revenues become entangled in bureaucratic structures, subject to administrative inefficiencies, delays, and ineffective allocation. Moreover, tariff-generated revenues can inadvertently incentivize governments to maintain protectionist policies longer than economically justified, creating situations where bureaucratic interests overshadow rational economic decision-making. Instead of reinvesting these funds efficiently into strategic initiatives such as industrial innovation, workforce retraining, or infrastructure improvements, governments frequently squander tariff revenues through administrative inefficiency, politically driven subsidies, or short-term relief measures lacking strategic foresight.\nTariffs: Rational Decision over Political Retaliation\nCanada’s overwhelming reliance on the U.S. market poses significant economic risks, particularly given the unpredictable nature of American trade policy. Diversification of trade partnerships must become central to Canada’s strategic economic planning. Existing agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, grant Canada access to rapidly growing markets in Asia, including Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Yet, Canadian exports to these regions remain modest, reflecting untapped opportunities. Similarly, Canada's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union remains underutilized due to persistent regulatory complexities and non-tariff barriers. Addressing these challenges proactively would significantly enhance Canadian businesses' access to diversified global markets, reducing vulnerability to U.S. trade policy fluctuations.\nRather than retaliation, Canada could focus on becoming a more attractive destination for investment, innovation, climate Technologies, and trade. Prioritizing internal economic strength, regulatory efficiency, and global market diversification will enable Canada to establish an economy resilient to external political disruptions. The present trade tensions could serve not as catalysts for harmful retaliatory tariffs but as opportunities to implement effective administrative reforms, promote sustainable development, expand international market access, and ultimately positioning Canada for prosperous, sustainable, and resilient economic growth well into the future.\nBusiness decisions are most effective when driven by economic merits like cost-effectiveness, competitive advantage, and market realities, rather than political or retaliatory impulses. That being said, it is possible that the threat of retaliation could serve as a strategic negotiation tactic, designed to signal Canada’s willingness to defend its interests and create leverage in trade discussions. In this case, it may be a calculated strategy to gain more favorable terms. Ultimately, the key is to balance assertiveness with a clear focus on long-term, sustainable growth rather than being drawn into a cycle of tit-for-tat measures that ultimately hurt both sides.",

        "text": "March Madness isn’t just about basketball anymore—it’s the biggest branding stage in college sports.\nFor decades, the NCAA Tournament has captivated fans with buzzer-beaters, Cinderella stories, and bracket-busting upsets. But in 2025, it’s also become the most valuable marketing platform in college sports. Thanks to Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), March Madness is no longer just a proving ground for athletes—it’s their prime earning window.\nHowever, this year’s tournament could be a turning point. The NCAA is hoping the House Settlement, set for potential approval on April 7—the same day as the men’s national championship— will rein in NIL deals that critics say have morphed into “pay-for-play” arrangements. If passed, a new NCAA committee will scrutinize NIL agreements, potentially reshaping the future of athlete compensation.\nMarch Madness as the Ultimate NIL Showcase\nFor college athletes, March Madness is more than just a championship quest—it’s the most significant branding moment of their careers. The NIL era has amplified this spotlight in several ways:\n✅ Viral moments create instant brand appeal: A game-winning shot, an electric post game interview, or an iconic dunk can turn an unknown player into an overnight sensation. Brands are quick to capitalize.\n✅ Big-time sponsors are now betting on college stars: Companies that once focused their marketing budgets on NBA players are shifting to college athletes, recognizing the authenticity and social media influence they bring.\n✅ For many, this is their peak earning window: Not every March Madness star will make it to the NBA, but for three weeks, they have a national stage to build their brand and cash in on endorsement deals.\nTwo Types of NIL Success Stories in March Madness\n🏀 Superstars Already Cashing In – The biggest names in college basketball secured six- and seven-figure NIL deals before the tournament even started.\n🏀 Tournament Heroes Rising Overnight – Cinderella stories aren’t just about wins anymore—they’re about NIL paydays. A breakout player who was unknown last week can trend on social media and land major endorsement deals overnight.\nWill NIL Keep Players in College Longer?\nOne of the most fascinating shifts in college basketball is how NIL earnings impact NBA Draft decisions.\n💰 Before NIL: Top prospects faced a tough choice—stay in college or jump to the G-League for a guaranteed $500,000 salary.\n💰 Now: Players can stay in school, build their brands, and make as much—or more—than they would in the G-League or overseas.\nHowever, if the House Settlement is approved, stricter oversight on NIL deals could change this dynamic. If earning potential is limited, more players may opt for the NBA route sooner rather than later.\nFinal Thought: The Last Dance for Unrestricted NIL?\nFor brands, sports marketers, and business leaders, March Madness isn’t just a basketball tournament—it’s a billion-dollar branding machine. This may be the final year of unfettered NIL, and if the House Settlement reshapes the landscape, it could signal the end of an era in college sports.\nThe big question: Will March Madness continue to be the premier NIL marketplace, or will NCAA regulations change the game? Either way, fans, brands, and players alike will be watching closely.",

        "text": "Topline\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday he’ll “vote to keep the government open” by voting to advance a Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown, even though House Democrats almost unanimously opposed the measure.\nKey Facts\nSchumer on Thursday said allowing the government to shut down would be a “distraction” for Democrats trying to combat President Donald Trump’s agenda, claiming a shutdown would only serve to benefit Trump and his chief cost-cutter Elon Musk.\nThe comments on the House floor came after the Schumer said Wednesday “Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate” to pass the resolution that would avert a shutdown, accusing Republicans of choosing “a partisan path, drafting their [bill] without any input, any input from congressional Democrats.”\nThe House approved the resolution in a 217-213 vote Tuesday, with one Republican, Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., voting against the legislation and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, voting for it.\nSeven Senate Democrats would need to side with all 53 Republicans in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster and pass the resolution that would keep the government funded through September after the midnight deadline Friday, when the current funding bill expires.\nAt least one other Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has said he’ll vote in favor of the bill, while one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has said he will vote against it.\nOther Democrats have said they’re on the fence about siding with Republicans, including Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va. and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., while Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., suggested he could be swayed if the bill is amended to include disaster aid for California’s wildfire crisis, Politico reported, and Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., told CNN voting for the House resolution “does seem the lesser of two very serious evils.”\nSenate Democrats are reportedly grappling with the decision whether to shut down the government—exposing them to attacks from Republicans and the potential even more government employees furloughed without pay could quit their jobs amid Trump’s mass layoff effort—or approve a bill written by the GOP that some Democrats have said gives the Trump administration broad leeway to dictate government spending, including freezing some funds, without congressional guardrails.\nCrucial Quote\n“A shutdown is uncharted territory when you've got an administration that, at least in some ways, probably would welcome a shutdown because that would give the president almost unlimited power in deciding who’s essential, who’s nonessential, holding up agencies,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told reporters Wednesday, calling it “a choice between two terrible alternatives.”\nChief Critic\n“Well, if there was a shutdown, at that point, it would be Chuck Schumer's shutdown because the Republicans are united in getting this done,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News Tuesday.\nKey Background\nThe House on Tuesday approved the bill that will keep fiscal year 2024 spending levels largely in place through the end of September, with a $13 billion cut to nondefense spending and a $6 billion increase in defense spending. Some Republicans who typically oppose what are known as “continuing resolutions”—or short-term measures to extend the existing spending plan to avert a shutdown and give Congress time to negotiate a new budget—citing a need for more cuts, said they agreed to support the bill given the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Trump urged all Republicans to unite behind the bill, and blasted Massie repeatedly, promising to back a primary challenge against him, when he refused to cave to Trump’s demands.\nFurther Reading\nHouse Approves Spending Bill Ahead Of Government Shutdown Deadline (Forbes)\nTrump Feuds With ‘Grandstander’ GOP Rep.

        "text": "TEFAF Maastricht opened with its first of two invitation-only preview days on Thursday. It’s too soon to tell how many collectors are in attendance but judging from the crowds of people on the showroom floor and the queue to enter the MECC Convention Center hours after the art, antique and design fair opened, the numbers appear quite robust. Not to mention that the vintage jewelry dealers were so busy I couldn’t interview them.\nThe contemporary high jewelry section opened with several new names. Among them, Santi, a London-based private jeweler founded by 36-year-old Krishna Choudhary, a descendent of family with long and deep-rooted ties to the gemstone industry in Jaipur, chose TEFAF for his first public art fair. His pink booth reflects the gemstone center of Jaipur, known as the Pink City. Inside he presented rare antiques that served as inspiration for the 20 or so contemporary artistic jewels he creates each year—most with historic gems that he collects.\nChoudhary said he couldn’t think of a better place to hold his first public fair.\n“TEFAF has this beautiful community of collectors and people offering the best of the best pieces. I could find an incredible Mughal dagger or find an incredible Gandhara sculpture,” Choudhary said. “This relates so much to me. I was setting up the booth and I was little tired. So, I walked around, and I got refreshed. I thought this is the ideal placement for me and I'm really excited to be here, because I think there are people who could really understand what I'm doing. There’s a calmness and there’s an appreciation.”\nAnother first-time exhibitor is Margot McKinney, the Australian high jeweler who manages to find the world’s most precious gems and pearls to produce big, bold colorful jewels. The centerpiece of her exhibition space is a green chandelier, and a working fountain made of Murano glass with colored flowers and nymphs in joyous poses. The ones on top of the fountain have wings. Near the bottom of the fountain are nymphs inside flowers and one nymph in the center is holding a string of pearls and a bracelet and a ring on her a left hand. The fountain and chandelier are made by Venetian glass artist Lucio Bubacco.\nMcKinney visited Bubacco’s studio in Murano, and “fell in love” with a green chandelier on display. When McKinney received her letter of approval to exhibit at TEFAF, she had the idea of a fountain and chandelier and she and Bubacco created the decorative object.\n“Pearls come from water and opals form in the presence of water. So, I thought water was what I needed.”\nShe was told by a TEFAF official there had never been a fountain in a stand, but it didn’t deter her.\n“It’s a lovely thing to have in here,” she said. “And it's proven to be a draw.”\nAmong the jewels she presented for her first exhibition is the Marina Necklace, made with extraordinarily large green beryl, aquamarine and green tourmaline set against a backdrop of 25 baroque Australian South Sea pearls. The jewel was inspired by the Great Barrier Reef, the gems n arranged to evoke the colors of the shimmering tropical waters of the Coral Sea and the marine theme is underscored by the pearls, harvested over several years from the seas of Australia’s far-north region. The gems were cut from fifth-generation gem-cutter Paul-Otto Caesar in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, a world-renowned center for skilled and artistic gem cutting.\nAll of Margot McKinney’s pearls come from a single pearl farmer, Aji Ellies Wimilirantna, who is with McKinney in her exhibition space. “It will be the first time many here will ever meet a pearl farmer,” she said.\nIt is not only McKinney’s first time at TEFAF but it is the first time she exhibited anywhere. “One of the greatest honors of my career has been the invitation to exhibit my work at the world’s most important art fair. It is a huge privilege for me personally and a milestone in the 141-year history of the McKinney family business.”\nBuccellati isn’t exactly new to TEFAF. The Italian jewelry brand previously exhibited at TEFAF from 1992 to 2014. Maria Cristina Buccellati said she couldn’t be happier with the her family’s company return. The brand, now owned by luxury goods holding company, Richemont, installed Nicolas Luchsinger a year ago as CEO. Maria Cristina said he thought it was important for the company to return to TEFAF and present its heritage pieces to show the company’s historical importance as well as present new high jewelry items that are for sale.\n“He understood that it was something necessary for us to come back and position ourselves in a way that goes back to our roots and showcase our heritage through high-level exhibitions like TEFAF,” she said.\nThe company also has new silver art objects available from its Furry collection.",

        "text": "Koh Samui has nearly four times the tourist density per square foot of the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris, one of the world’s most well-known overtourism hotspots.\nIn 2023, Koh Samui welcomed 3.54 million tourists, packing an island of just 88.3 square miles with an astonishing 40,111 visitors per square mile. This equates to almost 10,000 visitors per day.\nCompared to Île-de-France, including Paris, which saw 47.6 million tourist arrivals across 4,638 square miles, the region’s tourist density reached only 10,264 tourists per square mile.\nWhile it is already debatable how well the City of Light still combats overtourism, what would happen to Koh Samui if the number of tourist arrivals further increased in 2025 due to the 'White Lotus’ effect?\nSet-jetting, a trend where travelers visit filming locations, is getting popular every year. Hotels.com reported that two-thirds of travelers say movies and TV influence their travel choices in 2025, a 16% increase from last year.\nIn 2024, after Season 2 aired, searches on Hotels.com for San Domenico Palace in Sicily, the primary filming location, skyrocketed by 300%. Hotels.com now predicts a similar surge for Thailand following Season 3’s release.\nThailand Pushes For Hidden Gems Amid Tourism Boom\nThailand plans to capitalize on the 'White Lotus’ effect in 2025.\nThe Nation, one of Thailand’s leading English-language news outlets, reported on February 25 that during the 21st annual joint meeting of the Association of Thai Travel Agents (ATTA) and the Thai Hotels Association (THA) Thapanee Kiatphaibool, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), confirmed 2025 will be the year to attract high-spending international visitors.\nHowever, Thailand does not want to concentrate all arrivals in Koh Samui either. The governor also said they would like to encourage visitors to explore beyond the traditional hotspots and discover Thailand’s hidden gems. She mentioned Krabi, Hat Yai and Hua Hin as emerging destinations that TAT will focus on promoting.\nA spokesperson from Tourism Thailand already told the BBC that since the show airs during Thailand’s shoulder season, they expect a boost in visitor numbers during these quieter months when the country has more capacity compared to peak season.\nWhen I asked Aaron Henry, founder of Foundeast Asia, a marketing boutique agency in Bangkok, Thailand, in an email interview whether Koh Samui as crowded as people say, he said “More than other destinations, like Phuket, I find Koh Samui to be one that isolates visitors a bit in whatever resort you choose - which means it's only as crowded as wherever you've booked.”\nThe Luxury Escape You See In White Lotus May Not Even Be The Reality\nWhile Four Seasons Koh Samui served as the primary filming location, visitors expecting it to look exactly as it did in White Lotus Season 3 may get disappointed.\nMark Kamine, one of the executive producers of The White Lotus, revealed in an interview with the BBC that the show’s locations aren't always what they appear to be.\n\"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily, where we filmed Season 2, knows the beach isn’t actually where it seems to be,\" Kamine explained. He also confirmed that for Season 3, they shot different scenes in different hotels.\nAccording to a media release by Warner Bros, only select locations, Ratliff Family Villa, Ladies’ Villa, Rick & Chelsea's Room, breakfast and lunch restaurants, pool, beach, common areas, pathways, water hammocks, gym, boxing ring and Spirit House, were filmed at Four Seasons Koh Samui.\nThe series had several other filming locations. For example, the spa and Belinda’s Room are in Anantara Mai Khao Phuket, while the bar scenes were filmed in the Singing Bird Lounge at Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort. The lobby and the hotel driveway you see in the episodes are both in Anantara Bophut Koh Samui.\nIf Koh Samui is still your destination of choice, you should consider which hotel has the location you eager to experience.\nWhat Is The Vibe In Koh Samui?\nLaura Bernazano and her husband are frequent luxury hotel visitors and visited the island two years ago. They told me in an email interview that “Koh Samui tends to attract a younger, party-loving crowd, where even the great Four Seasons Resort cannot completely escape that vibe.”\nSabrina Stocker who spent 3 months in Koh Samui in 2024 said in an email interview “Just like Instagram highlights, White Lotus captures the most polished 20% of a place while cutting out the less glamorous 80%. Step outside the resort, and the contrast is striking.\"\nShe believes that Koh Samui has changed post-pandemic, with some areas thriving, while others struggling. Rows of abandoned hotels and empty restaurants serve as a stark reminders of the fragility of the island.\n“Some beaches feel like a private paradise, while others are lined with tourist-packed restaurants and resorts,” she says.\nGeorgia Fowkes, travel expert at Altezza Travel, who visited Koh Samui May 2024, shared in an email interview that night markets were insufferably crowded, but the island did not feel overwhelmingly packed.\nHowever, she still preferred the quieter southern beaches and the secluded areas of Maenam over Chaweng Beach, which is a major tourist hotspot for sun-seekers and nightlife enthusiasts.\nShe believes that if you are looking for an authentic Thai island experience, the key is choosing the right place and the right time.\nHow Can You Enjoy Luxury Without the Crowds? Travel Smarter\nAs Koh Samui braces for an inevitable surge in visitors following The White Lotus, the island is not the only destination in Thailand with upscale luxury tropical relaxation.\nWhile Bernazano enjoyed her time in Koh Samui, she appreciated the laid-back, peaceful vibe of Koh Kood, a remote island on the opposite side of the Gulf of Thailand from Koh Samui.\nJan Luescher, CEO of ASMALLWORLD, a luxury travel communitxy also recommended Koh Kood in an email interview as an excellent alternative. It is flying under the radar for now and offers unspoiled jungle, cascading waterfalls and flawless white-sand beaches without set-jetters.\nAlexandra Hepworth, founder of Layah Travel, seasoned travel advisor and luxury hospitality expert who visited Koh Samui multiple times recommended Krabi in an email interview due to its tranquility, high-end accommodations and impeccable service. “Lesser known and just as (if not more) beautiful than Koh Samui. There is now an international airport on Krabi so my advice is go before the crowds realize what they are missing!” she says.\nLuxury seekers who want to experience the five-star indulgence seen in The White Lotus, but without the crowds, can find a smart alternative in destinations like Koh Kood, Krabi or Hua Hin. Here are five luxury resorts that offer the same Koh Samui vibe in lesser-known locations.",

A similar surge is widely expected for Thailand following Season 3, and it’s not just Hotels.com predicting the trend.\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is also banking on The White Lotus effect, aiming to attract high-spending international visitors in 2025, as reported by The Nation.\nWith set-jetting, a trend of traveling to filming locations, growing in popularity, Koh Samui will indeed set to see a surge in interest.\nHowever, don’t chase The White Lotus filming locations in Thailand just yet. Koh Samui is already four times denser than Paris. Choose to travel smarter and find Thailand’s high-end experience without the crowds at one these five luxury resorts.\nThey offer a similar vibe of exclusivity and extravagance, but in lesser-known destinations and with a commitment to sustainability.\nSix Senses Yao Noi\nSix Senses Yao Noi is a five-star luxury resort on Yao Noi Island in Phang Nga Bay between Phuket and Krabi, only a 45-minute speedboat ride from Phuket. The island is home to unspoiled mangrove forests, quiet beaches, rubber and rice plantations.\nGuests can choose from 56 uniquely designed villas with private infinity pools and ocean-facing views. Adventure seekers will find plenty of opportunities to kayak in the mangrove forests, while diving enthusiasts can explore the marine life of Phang Nga Bay. The resort offers plenty of activities from on-site Muay Thai boxing lessons to tie-day workshops at Yao Noi Batik Centre.\nThe resort is part of Six Senses’s ‘Earth Lab’ initiative focusing on reducing consumption, eliminating waste and supporting local ecosystems and communities. The resort also partners with Imagine Thailand to provide clean drinking water to 25 locations and actively participates in hornbill conservation by creating artificial nests to support breeding. Six Senses Yoa Noi is the only private-sector participant in Thailand’s Royal Plant Genetic Conservation Project, advancing ecological research and sustainable agriculture.\nSoneva Kiri\nSoneva Kiri is a remote eco-luxury resort on Koh Kood Island, near the Cambodian border, on the opposite side of the Gulf of Thailand from Koh Samui. It is one of Thailand’s least developed islands and the resort is only accessible via a private charter flight, followed by a speedboat transfer.\nBut remote comes with space, privacy and untouched nature. \"Unlike Koh Samui, which is now densely built-up with resorts and tourist hotspots, Koh Kood remains wild, offering pristine beaches, waterfalls, and crystal-clear waters where you can still snorkel and see vibrant marine life without crowds,\" says Aleksandra Loustau, senior communications manager at Soneva in an email interview.\nSoneva has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to sustainability,\" says Loustau. The resort eliminated plastic long ago, turns food scraps into compost for the organic garden, creates coconut oil from waste and even make charcoal for cooking. It operates carbon neutral since 2012.\nThe Soneva Foundation supports environmental and community projects in multiple locations worldwide, like coral restoration in the Maldives or large-scale reforestation in Thailand. In 2011-2012, the foundation partnered with the PATT Foundation (Plant A Tree Today) to plant over 500,000 trees across 300 acres in northern Thailand’s Chiang Mai region.\nThe Sarojin\nThe Sarojin is a five-star resort in Khao Lak, approximately one hour north of Phuket, on Thailand’s Andaman coast. Its proximity to five spectacular national parks like Si Phang Nga National Park and Khao Sok National Park and world-famous dive sites of the Similan and Surin Islands, makes it an ideal destination for eco-conscious travelers seeking high-end accommodations near protected natural areas.\nAndrew Kemp, owner of The Saorjin, shared in an email interview that his vision for The Sarojin was to create an ethical, sustainable luxury retreat that delivers an exceptional guest experience while giving back to the local community and environment.\nHe chose Khao Lak for its natural beauty and easily accessible, still off-the-beaten-path appeal. Also acknowledging the area’s vulnerable state, The Sarojin launched the One Booking One Tree initiative in partnership with Phang Nga National Parks, the Mangrove Forest Planting Project in Baan Nam Kem, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, the Takuapa Local Government and the Ban Nam Khem and Bang Nai Si communities in 2022.\nSince its launch the initiative planted 3,845 mangrove trees along the coastline among others in Pakarang Cape and Bangsak Beach.\nBanyan Tree Krabi\nBanyan Tree Krabi is a five-star luxury resort in Krabi, facing Phang Nga Bay, directly opposite Six Senses Yao Noi. It is close to the caves of Railay Beach, Wat Tham Suea, a Buddhist temple in Krabi Noi, the Hong Islands and other key attractions in Krabi.\nThe resort features 72 luxurious suites and villas, each with a private pool. One of the highlights is the Wellness Sanctuary which includes Krabi’s first hydrotherapy spa, The Rainforest. It is a hydrothermal circuit with rain walk, steam room, sauna, ice fountain, vitality pool, outdoor hot and cold plunge pools, jet pool and heated beds.\nThe Wellness Sanctuary is also the place to join a variety of classes from tai chi to forest bathing or Thai potpourri making.\nBanyan Tree Krabi focuses on minimizing environmental impact by improving energy efficiency, reducing waste and adopting sustainable practices in operations. It has already received Green Hotel Award’s Gold Certification and the Kinnaree Award. The Group, as a whole, reduced the emissions intensity per occupied room by 22% in 2023.\nTo celebrate 30 years, Banyan Group is launching the Rewilding Banyan Fund, pledging $1 per direct booking to habitat restoration starting November 1. It will extend the Laguna Phuket pilot project, which created a high-density, self-sustaining biodiverse forest by planting 7,500 native trees, to 10 additional locations in Thailand.\nHyatt Regency Hua Hin\nHyatt Regency Hua Hin is a five-star beachfront luxury hotel in Hua Hin, a coastal resort town on the Gulf of Thailand, about 2.5 to 3 hours south of Bangkok by car.\nHua Hin became Thailand’s first beach getaway when King Rama VII built Klai Kangwon Palace in 1929 that later became the primary summer residence of late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) of Thailand.\nHyatt Regency Hua Hin offers a similar level of luxury and amenities, including a range of beachfront pools and the award-winning The BARAI spa.\nHyatt Regency Hua Hin is committed to sustainability through initiatives like the \"Pick up three pieces of rubbish when you visit the beach\" campaign, the use of glass water bottles and locally sourced food. The hotel holds ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 22000:2018 certifications, reflecting its dedication to environmental responsibility and food safety.",

        "text": "On Tuesday night, 800 lucky Goose fans snaked they way through the Shed at Hudson Yards to enter a world where music and art fused in a swirling, electric dreamscape. At the heart of it all: Goose, the genre-defying band whose meteoric rise has shattered expectations, playing an electrifying set inside Luna Luna to celebrate its new album, Everything Must Go.\nFrom the moment the doors opened, it was clear this wasn’t just another concert, but an immersive experience designed to transport fans deep into the band’s surreal visual universe. Inside the traveling art carnival, luminescent characters lifted straight from the album’s illustrations roamed the venue, their exaggerated features and costumes making the crowd feel as if they had stepped right off the album cover. Bathed in the neon glow of Basquiats, Keith Herrings, and Dalís, the space pulsed with tunes spun by producer Abe Seiferth, along with an energy that felt both nostalgic and futuristic, as if Luna Luna had been waiting decades for this exact moment.\nAmidst the carnival, members of Goose clad in animal onesies made their way to the center of the room and loaded onto an intimate circular stage, where they tore through a jam-heavy, hypnotic set that wove seamlessly into the psychedelic surroundings. The band played for just over an hour, their sound crackling through the space like a current, synchronized with swirling lights and the moves of the costumed characters. Stuart Bogie joined the band on woodwinds.\nThe creative mastermind behind the evening’s immersive elements was Justin Bolognino of Meta, an experiential agency that transforms live events into visceral, multi-sensory experiences.\n\"Goose brought me on to bolster what they do musically with something even bigger,” Bolognino said. \"If you look at Everything Must Go, it’s filled with these illustrated characters, so the concept was simple: what if we brought them to life inside Luna Luna? How better to show the world that Goose is more than a jam band—that they’re artists of the highest caliber—than by placing them inside of iconic art?\"\nBognino pointed out that experiential events like this aren’t a trend—they’re a necessity in an era where digital saturation has left audiences craving something tangible. “People want visceral experiences,” he said. “Our characters got in your face, pulled you around, made you feel something. That’s what we’re trying to do—because in the digital world, you don’t feel anything but anger anymore.”\nFor Goose, the event was just the beginning. The band’s first-ever festival in Cabo San José, Mexico is on the horizon, promising another deep dive into immersive artistry. Beyond that, Bolognino plans to continue pushing boundaries with the band and otherwise, with projects like Spirit Lake, a mind-bending world within the annual Hulaween festival, and a forthcoming documentary on the psychedelic renaissance.\nBut Tuesday was about Goose—about the music, the art, and the magic of Luna Luna. As the final notes rang out and the lights dimmed, the crowd emerged from the experience as if they too had stepped inside the album and lived within its surrealist world, even if just for an evening.",

        "text": "Performance art, which was once thought to be a dying form, stands the test of time with DOOM, a performance directed by Anne Imhof. Although not presented in a definitive space where the body and its behavioral form are used for exhibition, the three-hour performance stood in the structure in more of a play, literally, and figuratively with a remake of Romeo and Juliet in the middle of its course.\nMaybe this very notion of “performance” was realized upon arrival. As the audience pressed into a tight corner of the Park Avenue Armory, a jumbotron illuminated the darkened gymnasium, its bright red digits counting down with an eerie finality. In that moment, it felt as though the spectacle wasn’t confined to the stage but extended to the crowd itself—their restless movements, shifting gazes, and the silent negotiations with time, each person acutely aware of its fleeting nature. Three hours was all that was given and asked for. And within the first few minutes, I couldn't help but question: Was the true exhibition the choreography of the audience's unease, the quiet tension between them, or the looming presence of time itself? This was until loud shrieks filled the room. The gates that held us in captivity were released and the audience was free to find their way through the space overtaken by towering black Cadillacs. While not functional, the shiny cars served as props for young kids to vape, scroll on their phones, and screech on top of. You know, typical teenage stuff. Young performers, who all looked as if they crawled from lower level staircases that lead to sketchy store-fronts on St.Marks street, moved through dance. And it was the first time they convinced the audience to pull away from the overly curated costuming and heavy-handed chants meant to signal rebellion against the anxieties of modern legislation and the overarching dysfunction of the Western world.\nAnne Imhof’s name holds power and a kind of elusivity that stands one-of-one in true artistic value. Wrapped in some fluff, it’s still enough to make her a household name among the great performance artists who never had to exist within the confines of a digital-progressive world. And it would be remiss not to recognize how earnestly that was received. A stuffy, almost self-important audience was confronted with a deliberately unserious gaze, one that stops just short of fully immersing itself in politics for fear of overcommitment. In this performance, the younger generation stands at the precipice of disorder, holding both the volatility of chaos and the mechanisms of policy in their hands. And yet, certain elements of the performance feel almost too self-conscious—so intent on signaling profundity that it collapsed into the superficial at some moments.\nLIA LIA, a Chinese-German singer who lead a rock band for a pop-punk set in the performance, first met Anne at the wedding of the founding member of Pussy Riot. After hearing LIA LIA’s music, Anne was immediately drawn to her and wanted to include her in the project. *\"I don't think Anne works with just anyone, so I think she created this beautiful dream of an American high school for us,\" she says.\nLIA LIA elaborates on Anne’s unique approach to casting, \"I feel Anne looks for the character instead of writing the character and then finding someone blank. She reaches out to people she believes embody a role and then amplifies their talent. I think she's very good at bringing people together.\"\n\"The most fun show was the one just for kids—there were like 700 college students, and everyone was so reactive,\" says LIA LIA. She recalls being struck by how much more engaged the younger audience was compared to the older, more traditional art crowd. \"The older art crowd is so serious,\" she says.\nAnd some of these select members from the \"older art crowd\" came from New York Times writer Jason Farago, whose review, was published the week of the premiere, and left a lasting impression. \"No one was ever that mean to me, ever. He seriously roasted me and all the women,\" she says. Farago’s scathing words read: \"A deafening band whose baby-punk singer would get booed off the stage at a suburban bar mitzvah, let alone Park Avenue.\" LIA LIA’s response is sharp and to the point: \"It was obviously written by a man.\"\nImhof’s German background felt all the more pronounced in a space so deliberately American. The floor, transformed into a gymnasium, set the stage for a rock-band performance complete with cheerleaders, while performers in basketball uniforms moved through the scene. The backdrop? The erosion of trans rights and the intensity of teenage love—what could be more American than that?\n\"First, what we talked about was Romeo and Juliet,\" says LIA LIA. Anne assigned them homework: to analyze the text and engage in discussions about its broader themes. \"We actually weren't talking about the youth now, we were more talking about the past and how beautiful Romeo and Juliet is because it's like the origin of a lot of literature and art,\" she explains. The rest remained unspoken, \"Everything else was not communicated. It was just asked that we would all be together.\"\nThe theme of everlasting, almost fatal romance was the most honest and fully realized aspect of the performance, maybe because Shakespeare, not Imhof, first conceived it. Yet Imhof’s interpretation of Romeo And Juliet cited in reverse touched on affection as something so deep and otherworldly that it leads to self-infliction. And it felt strikingly relevant to the modern-particularly-digital age where affection and community are desolate. A performer was always present, phone in hand, capturing the moment and projecting it onto the jumbotron. The idea of framing performance through an iPhone has become increasingly prevalent, especially in music, with artists like Rosalía, Beyoncé, and Angèle incorporating it into their own productions. But here, the projected iPhone feed, capturing the entirety of the durational performance between the glowing countdown, seemed to point toward a broader commentary on the state of surveillance.\nAnd, once again, that message was delivered almost too transparently. Narrators declared photography to be the greatest affliction of this generation, while an on-stage performer, acting as a photographer, actively disrupted parts of the performance, forcing the audience to acknowledge their presence. Ironically, this was accompanied by the claim that nothing captured on camera could ever be as pure as what is seen in real life. While that sentiment may hold some truth, and led to a few audience members tucking their phones away sheepishly, it ultimately fed into the most prevalent echo chamber to date. It was the usual rhetoric that technology is corrupting, social media is disruptive, and digital photography is exploitative—narratives the audience had likely already internalized before stepping into the space.\nThe most glaring contradiction? Imhof herself discreetly snapped photos and videos of the performance, only to post them later on her personal social media to promote the show, the very way most people had discovered it in the first place.\nAnother well-executed theme was the tension between surrender and discipline. The performance posed a compelling question: does surrendering to oneself—or to something greater—ultimately cultivate discipline, or is it the other way around? This dynamic was reinforced in the recurring chant, “For heroes, there are trials,” which framed the stage as a battleground where two performers engaged in a duel—one destined to surrender. Chants such as “I want discipline” and “I won’t disappear” echoed throughout, their rhythmic delivery backing the contemplation on when to relinquish control and when to assert it. Through dance, drills, and movement, the performance became a study, inviting the audience to consider their own endurance. Were they disciplined enough to withstand the full three-hour experience, or would they surrender to the weight of time itself? Especially if it's staring at you blown up on a jumbotron.\nBy the final hour, many—including myself—were yearning for a moment of clarity, for art stripped of excess, not reliant on post-intellectualization, but something immediate, something to be felt in real-time. Then, from backstage, a male ballet dancer emerged, stretching and warming up as a punk band—led by artist LIA LIA—finished off their almost stereotypical “after-prom” set from the right stage. The atmosphere was charged. From above the stage, a brooding electric guitar reverberated through the space as the dancer pirouetted onto the stage alone, only to be gradually joined by others, their movements synchronized with the live accompaniment of a classical pianist. It was here, in this collision of genres and forms, that the performance reached its most poignant and authentic moment of unity—a gesture of hope that, perhaps, even Imhoff had been searching for.",

        "text": "GRAMMY-winning singer/songwriter Chris Tomlin has written 21 No. 1 hits, sold more than 12 million albums, and won 30 Dove Awards, most recently for Song of the Year for “Holy Forever.” He was also the first Christian artist to reach the billion streams threshold on Pandora.\nAnd while he’s written songs for movies in the past, he’s never felt the call to delve any deeper into the filmmaking world - until now.\nWhen the team behind The Last Supper approached him to ask if he had a song that might work for their upcoming movie, Tomlin sat down and watched the film. He says he was immediately struck by how beautifully it was shot, the way it accurately follows the Bible, and the unique story it tells.\n“Most of the time anything around Jesus usually focuses on the cross or the resurrection,” Tomlin says. “And I love how this movie makes ‘the last supper’ a central piece. It humanizes everything that happened during Jesus’ final days. When we read stories about disciples, we think of them as mythical, but they were real people. I went to Israel several years ago and the trip brought the black and white pages to color for me. I feel like this movie does the same thing.”\nAfter watching The Last Supper, he signed on as Executive Producer. And it turns out he “did” have just the right song.\n“I’d just written this brand-new song at a writing retreat with songwriters Tyler Hubbard, Corey Crowder, and Matt Jenkins. And I hadn’t even played it for anyone yet. It’s called “No Greater love” and it’s inspired by the verse John 15:13 which says, ‘Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for one’s friends.’ When the film team heard it, everyone said, 'That’s the song!\"\nTo listen to it now, as it plays during the closing credits, it’s as if Tomlin wrote it specifically with the movie in mind.\n“It just worked together so perfectly,” he says. “It’s one of those Godwink moments.”\nAs Tomlin celebrates his first foray into filmmaking, the ever-busy singer/songwriter is hard at work on a host of other projects. He’s currently on tour which includes three special “Under the Stars” performances at Central Park in New York, Pier Six in Baltimore, and Red Rocks in Denver. And he’ll mark his 9th annual Good Friday celebration at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena on April 18th.\nAlso in April, Tomlin will help bring a small part of world history to life that most people know nothing about. It involves the first “hymn” ever discovered.\n“Outside of the Bible, the first hymn ever discovered was found in a scrap heap in Egypt,” Tomlin explains. “It’s just a scrap of paper dated in 200 AD, so it’s about 1800 years old. It’s been locked away in this vault in Oxford and a historian brought it out with plans for a documentary. He came to me and a friend, Ben Fielding, and asked if we’d be interested in reviving the lyrics and writing a new melody to it. So, we did. It’s called “The First Hymn” and it’ll be released in April.”\nTomlin says he’s grateful for each new opportunity to spread the word of God. When he began writing songs and performing live more than two decades ago, he never imagined how many people his music might reach.\n“It’s been the privilege of my life, and I mean it. Seeing you’re just a part of something that’s so much bigger than what you. I never could have dreamed it. I know God is the wind and the sails.”\nHe’s excited about the The Last Supper and hopes it connects with those who need it.\n“My favorite thing on the movie poster is where it says, ‘All Are Welcome At The Table.’ And that’s at the heart of this movie. During the last supper, Jesus breaks the bread, raises the cup, says this is my body, this is my blood, and he knows someone at the table is going to betray him, another is going to deny him.’ And yet, he still says ‘I’m giving my life for you.’ I hope it shows people you don’t have to be perfect. I think that message is so powerful.”\nThe Pinnacle Peak Pictures film, produced by Michael Scott and directed by Mauro Borrelli, hits theaters this weekend.\nTomlin’s song “No Greater Love” is currently available on all streaming platforms.",

        "text": "The UFC’s next pay-per-view fight card, UFC 314, is stacked. The card might be the best PPV card the UFC has staged since last April’s UFC 300. In the main event of UFC 314, former UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski faces the fast-rising Diego Lopes for the vacant UFC featherweight title. Meanwhile, in the main event, Paddy Pimblett looks to continue his climb up the lightweight rankings when he faces former title challenger Michael Chandler. UFC 314 takes place on Saturday, April 12 at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida. We look at the opening betting odds for Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett matchup.\nUFC 314 Fight Card: Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett\nMichael Chandler\nMichael Chandler (23-9) missed a lot of time over the past few years waiting for a bout opposite Conor McGregor to come together. With that fight looking less likely by the day, Chandler returned to the Octagon on November 2024 to face former UFC champion Charles Oliveira. It was Chandler’s first foray into the cage since a 2022 loss to Dustin Poirier. Oliveira downed Chandler via decision at UFC 309.\nChandler joined the UFC in 2021 after a long and successful tenure with Bellator. As a competitor for that promotion from 2010 through 2020, Chandler was a three-time lightweight champion. He defended the title twice during his first run with the belt and once during his second stint as champ. His third run as Bellator lightweight champ ended with a TKO loss to Patricio \"Pitbull\" Freire, who is making his UFC debut at UFC 314.\nChandler is 2-4 with the UFC, but outside his 2022 matchup against a fading Tony Ferguson, the 38-year-old has only faced the elite of the division. In addition to his bouts against Poirier and Oliveira, he has met Dan Hooker and Justin Gaethje inside the Octagon.\nChandler’s UFC wins came against Hooker (TKO) and Ferguson (knockout). The former Bellator champ is the No. 7 ranked competitor in the official UFC lightweight rankings.\nPaddy Pimblett (22-3) is a former Cage Warriors lightweight champion. He has slowly been working his way up the UFC rankings since making his promotional debut in September 2021. Now 6-0 with the UFC, Pimblett looks to take a step up in competition against Chandler. Pimblett is coming off a UFC 304 “Performance of the Night” bonus-winning submission win over Bobby Green.\nPimblett had a successful run with the Cage Warriors promotion before he joined the UFC in 2021. During his time with Cage Warriors, which spanned 2013 through 2021, Pimblett won and defended the CW featherweight title and fought for that promotion’s lightweight crown.\nPimblett has been a fan favorite since he made his UFC debut and while some have been critical of the matchmaking the UFC have provided for Pimblett, something he addressed at the UFC 314 pre-fight press conference, Pimblett is in for a big test against Chandler.\nPimblett is the No. 12 ranked UFC 155-pound fighter.\nUFC 314 Co-Main Event Opening Odds\nWhen the opening odds were announced for this matchup, Chandler was the -140 favorite over the +120 Pimblett. Those odds have flipped. Today, Pimblett is a -130 favorite, while Chandler is the +110 betting underdog.\n*Odds via BetOnline\nUFC 314 Main Event Opening Odds - Volkanovski Vs.

        "text": "The 2025 NWSL season kicks off with a thrilling showdown as the reigning champions, Orlando Pride, host Chicago Stars FC at Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, FL. This highly anticipated season opener will be broadcast live on Prime Video at 8 PM EST/5 PM PST on Friday, March 14.\nWith the excitement surrounding the new season, all eyes will be on the Pride as they aim to defend their title and set the tone for another championship campaign.\nMeanwhile, the Stars are eager to prove themselves as contenders, looking to shake off last season’s struggles and make an early statement against the league’s top team. The opening match will serve as a litmus test for both squads, offering a glimpse into their form and aspirations for the year ahead.\nNWSL: Orlando Pride’s Title Defense Begins\nOrlando Pride enters the new season with momentum after claiming both the NWSL Shield and Championship in 2024. Their attack is headlined by Zambian forward Barbra Banda, who had an outstanding debut season, scoring 17 goals in 25 matches—ranking second in the league behind Kansas City Current’s Chawinga. Banda’s versatility and ability to track back defensively make her a crucial asset for Orlando’s lineup.\nAnother key figure for the Pride is Brazilian legend Marta, who returns for her ninth NWSL season. The six-time FIFA World Player of the Year added two missing trophies to her illustrious career last season, further solidifying her place in the record books. Despite speculation about retirement, Marta signed a two-year extension with the club, ensuring her leadership and playmaking abilities remain at the heart of Orlando’s title defense.\nOrlando Pride sporting director Haley Carter emphasized the importance of Marta’s re-signing as reported by ESPN, stating, “The impact she has made on our team, our locker room and our community is evident, of course through her incredible skill as a player, but even more so through her selfless and exemplary leadership style.” With the pressure of being reigning champions, the Pride will aim to set the tone for another successful season with a dominant opening performance.\nNWSL: Chicago Stars FC Aiming For A Fresh Start\nThe Chicago Stars FC enter the season looking to improve upon their eighth-place finish in 2024. However, they face a tough challenge in their season opener, especially with star forward Mallory Swanson ruled out for the match. Swanson’s absence leaves a significant void in Chicago’s attack, but they will look to other players to step up in her place.\nDefensively, Chicago will rely on veteran goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher to hold off Orlando’s dangerous front line. Naeher, an 11-year NWSL veteran and longtime USWNT goalkeeper, has been a rock for the club since joining in 2016. In 2024, she was ranked 30th on ESPN’s list of the top 50 women’s soccer players in the world, underscoring her importance to the team.\nChicago also bolstered their backline with the signing of rookie defender Justine Gaynor from Michigan State. A standout in college, Gaynor contributed 17 goals and 20 assists in 83 matches for the Spartans and was named to the All-Big Ten first team in both 2022 and 2023. Her addition provides a much-needed boost to Chicago’s defensive unit.\nNWSL Season 2025 Opening Weekend Matchups\nThe Orlando Pride vs. Chicago Stars FC matchup is just the beginning of an exciting NWSL opening weekend. Fans can look forward to a slate of high-stakes games across the league:\n- Friday, March 14: Houston Dash vs. Washington Spirit (8 PM EST/5 PM PST, NWSL+)\n- Saturday, March 15: KC Current vs. Portland Thorns (12:45 PM EST/9:45 AM PST, ABC/ESPN+)\n- Saturday, March 15: Racing Louisville FC vs. North Carolina Courage (5 PM EST/2 PM PST, NWSL+)\n- Saturday, March 15: Utah Royals FC vs. Bay FC (7:30 PM EST/4:30 PM PST, ION)\n- Saturday, March 15: Seattle Reign vs. Gotham FC (10:00 PM EST/7:00 PM PST, ION)\n- Sunday, March 16: Angel City FC vs. San Diego Wave (6:50 PM EST/3:50 PM PST, ESPN2/ESPN+)\nWith the Pride looking to make a statement in their first NWSL match as defending champions and the Stars seeking a strong start to the season, this opening night showdown promises to be an exciting battle.",

        "text": "In traditional mentorship, knowledge typically flows one way—senior leaders guiding younger employees. But today’s most forward-thinking leaders are embracing something different: reverse mentorship—where learning flows both ways.\nWith rapid shifts in technology, culture, and communication, leaders who fail to engage with younger generations risk falling behind. Gen Z and Millennials bring fresh perspectives, digital fluency, and new ways of thinking that can unlock powerful insights for the most seasoned professionals.\nHere’s why reverse mentorship is no longer a “nice to have”—it’s essential for leaders who want to stay relevant, innovative, and connected.\nWhy Reverse Mentorship Matters in 2025\nThe workplace is evolving faster than ever. Technology, social media, and cultural shifts have fundamentally changed how we communicate, collaborate, and build influence. Younger generations are driving these changes—and they’re redefining leadership in the process.\nHere’s what leaders gain when they embrace reverse mentorship:\nDigital Fluency: Gen Z grew up in a world of social media, digital storytelling, and rapid information-sharing. They understand emerging platforms, content trends, and engagement tactics that traditional leaders may struggle to keep pace with.\nCultural Awareness: From TikTok trends to internet slang to shifting social norms, Gen Z and Millennials have their fingers on the pulse of culture. Leaders who listen gain insights that shape stronger communication, marketing, and decision-making.\nFresh Perspectives: Younger employees bring bold ideas, challenge outdated norms, and offer insights on what resonates with modern audiences. They’re often deeply attuned to issues like inclusivity, sustainability, and purpose-driven business models.\nNew Ways of Working: Younger generations embrace flexible work, remote collaboration, and purpose-driven leadership. Learning from them can inspire leaders to create more adaptive, empowering workplace environments.\nHow to Implement Reverse Mentorship\nCreating a successful reverse mentorship dynamic isn’t about assigning “mentors” and “mentees.” It’s about building authentic, two-way relationships where both parties learn from one another.\nHere’s how to do it:\n- Be Intentional About Learning → Approach reverse mentorship with curiosity and humility. Ask thoughtful questions about digital trends, cultural shifts, and communication styles. Be open to feedback—even if it challenges your perspective.\n- Create Space for Dialogue → Set regular check-ins where younger employees can share insights in an open space. These conversations shouldn’t feel forced—create an environment where they can speak honestly and you can listen actively.\n- Ask for Digital Insights → Struggling with LinkedIn growth? Confused about TikTok trends? Ask your Gen Z or Millennial colleagues for guidance. Their first-hand experience can provide invaluable insights for your personal brand and professional presence.\n- Embrace Reverse Mentorship in Teams → Encourage team-wide knowledge sharing by inviting younger team members to lead training sessions on emerging tech, communication tools, or cultural insights. These moments empower rising talent while fostering a learning environment.\n- Don’t Just Learn—Act → Reverse mentorship works best when leaders apply what they’ve learned. Whether it’s adapting your leadership style, refreshing your brand, or adopting new digital strategies, be willing to implement the insights you gain.\nLeaders Who Embrace Reverse Mentorship Will Win\nThe leaders who stay ahead are the ones who stay curious. They know that experience is powerful—but only when paired with an openness to new ideas.\nEmbracing reverse mentorship isn’t just about learning—it’s about leading with relevance. When leaders actively listen, adapt, and evolve, they become more effective mentors themselves—and build stronger connections with their teams.",

        "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2025/03/13/mahmoud-khalil-case-an-abuse-of-immigration-law-for-political-purposes/",
        "text": "The arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident who was studying at Columbia University, has ignited widespread condemnation from human rights groups and civil liberties advocates, who accuse Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of politically motivated targeting. If anything, the Mahmoud Khalil arrest appears to be an immigration abuse.\nKhalil, known for his outspoken advocacy on Palestinian human rights, was taken into ICE custody earlier this week and transported to a privately run detention facility in Jena, Louisiana—thousands of miles from his home in New York, where his wife is eight months pregnant. According to Freedom for Immigrants (FFI), a national watchdog group, Khalil’s arrest follows a disturbing pattern of enforced disappearances and retaliatory detentions carried out by ICE to silence political dissent.\n“The abduction of Mahmoud is textbook authoritarian conduct by the MAGA regime. This blatant assault on Mahmoud’s most basic civil liberties is an affront to the fundamental rights of free speech, political dissent, and due process everywhere,” said Laura Hernández, executive director of FFI.\nA System of Retaliation and Disappearance\nKhalil’s detention is the latest in what advocates say is a systemic effort by ICE to suppress activism and intimidate immigrants engaged in political organizing. FFI’s recent report, Detained and Disappeared, documented 698 instances of enforced disappearances in ICE custody between 2017 and 2021, with individuals frequently transferred to remote facilities without notifying their families or attorneys.\n“Immigrant detention centers across the country, like the privately-operated facility in Jena, Louisiana, where Mahmoud is being held, have long been plagued by deaths, racist violence against immigrants, and a culture of impunity and secrecy that emboldens ICE to further its abuse. Enforced disappearances and retaliatory transfers of individuals thousands of miles away from their families and attorneys have long been systemic features — not bugs — of the dehumanizing detention system,\" said Hernandez.\nAccording to FFI, many detainees are transferred under pretense or without justification, a practice the organization says constitutes “enforced disappearance” under international law. ICE’s online detainee locator, the primary tool for tracking individuals in custody, has been criticized for its inaccuracies, making it even harder for families and attorneys to find those who have been detained.\nPolitical Targeting Under the Guise of Immigration Enforcement\nKhalil, a legal permanent resident, is not accused of any crime and has not violated immigration laws. Instead, advocates argue his detention is politically motivated—an attempt to punish him for his activism on behalf of Palestinian rights. But his conduct did not involve any espionage, sabotage, treason, or terrorism or membership in terrorist organizations or involvement in acts of terror—grounds for deporting a green card holder on security-related matters. His arrest comes amid heightened tensions on university campuses over free speech and student-led movements critical of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly regarding Gaza.\nLegal experts warn that the government’s actions against Khalil set a dangerous precedent. Targeting lawful permanent residents in this way is a violation of constitutional rights and due process.\nKhalil’s detainment also raises concerns about ICE’s use of private, for-profit detention centers, where conditions have been widely condemned. The Jena, Louisiana facility where he is currently held has been the subject of multiple allegations of human rights violations, including lack of medical care, physical abuse, and prolonged solitary confinement.\nGrowing Calls for Khalil’s Release\nKhalil’s arrest has sparked widespread protests, with students at Columbia University staging demonstrations demanding his immediate release. Faculty members, civil rights organizations, and elected officials have also called on the Trump administration to intervene.\nMahmoud Khalil is being detained not because of any criminal conduct, but because he dared to speak out according to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). She said, “If the federal government can disappear a legal US permanent resident without reason or warrant, then they can disappear US citizens too.”\nColumbia University has yet to release an official statement, but faculty members have urged the administration to take a stronger stand. Advocates are also calling on universities nationwide to adopt sanctuary policies that restrict ICE’s presence on campuses and prohibit institutional cooperation with immigration enforcement.\nWith Khalil’s wife nearing the end of her pregnancy, his supporters stress the urgency of his case. As public pressure mounts, Khalil’s fate remains uncertain. What is clear, however, is that his detention has become a rallying cry against the broader abuses of the immigration detention system, which critics argue has been transformed into a tool for political suppression. In short, Khalil’s arrest is an immigration abuse that needs to be rectified.",

        "text": "Singaporean self-taught artist and designer David Lee, the creative force behind I Am Not David Lee art studio, champions anonymity to let his works do the talking, emphasizing that creation transcends individual identity and emerges from collective input. He left his full-time job in the creative industry behind to fully embrace his passion for art, and when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, he ventured into experimental design. Seamlessly blending art and design, he experiments with everyday materials, defying conventional norms to uncover their hidden potential and introduce innovation through controlled chaos. For him, experimentation is a core principle, allowing him to explore uncharted creative territories beyond traditional constraints.\nThis innovative approach led Lee to craft sculptural furniture – such as his Monolith chair and table – made from a single piece of aluminum alloy through laser-cutting and bending, a process that challenges the resource-intensive complexity of traditional furniture production, while prioritizing sustainability and reducing environmental impact. There’s also his Ugly Ducting light experiment sculpture, inspired by scribbling, which transforms a simple washing machine duct hose into a striking three-dimensional luminous form via a method he refers to as “bricolage”. The glowing, uneven lines appear to float in mid-air, giving the impression of an artist’s sketch brought to life. He discusses his design philosophy.\nThe Monolith chair’s production process emphasizes minimizing waste, conserving human resources and reducing environmental impact. Can you walk us through the specific methods or techniques you employed to achieve these sustainability goals, and how they informed the overall design, functionality and esthetic appeal?\nThe Monolith chair represents a shift from traditional chair production methods by emphasizing sustainability through a streamlined approach. Traditionally, chair production involves managing around 12 components from three different materials, processed through multiple machines and handled by several individuals, which leads to significant waste and resource use. In contrast, the Monolith chair is made from a single piece of aluminum, which is laser-cut and bent using a traditional bending method call “bump-bending”. This method, known for its cost-effectiveness and reducing additional tooling requirements, minimizes waste by reducing the need for multiple components and extensive labor.\nThe Monolith chair’s design is a result of its production methods: clean lines and lack of visible joints which contributes to its sleek, contemporary look, reflecting a commitment to both functionality and environmental responsibility. It showcases a thoughtful approach to sustainability, combining material efficiency, reduced labor and a minimal environmental footprint with striking design and functionality.\nWhy did you choose aluminum as a material?\nThis streamlined production process offers several sustainability benefits. By using only one material and a simplified manufacturing process, the Monolith chair significantly cuts down on material waste and the need for human resources. Aluminum, chosen for its recyclability, can be reused indefinitely without losing quality, which reduces raw material needs and energy consumption, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, aluminum’s durability ensures a longer lifespan for the chair, reducing the frequency of replacements and further minimizing environmental impact.\nHow do you see your approach influencing the future of furniture design, and what message do you hope your work will convey to both designers and consumers regarding sustainability?\nMy approach with the Monolith chair aims to significantly influence the future of furniture design by showcasing how a conventional production method can set new standards for sustainability. This design conveys a clear message about the importance of integrating production methods and material knowledge in design. I strongly believe that sustainability goes beyond just using eco-friendly materials, technology or AI; it involves optimizing production methods to minimize waste and conserve resources. By adopting a more efficient manufacturing process and questioning traditional practices, I advocate for a shift toward more thoughtful, resource-efficient design. My aim for Monolith is to demonstrate that sustainability can be seamlessly incorporated into design without compromising on quality or esthetics.\nWhat’s your definition of “sustainability”, and are the solutions, materials or methods you proposed truly sustainable?\nMy definition of sustainability is about creating solutions that have a lower environmental impact throughout their life cycle, and improving existing practices to drive broader systemic change. The Monolith chair aligns with this definition through its use of a single material and a simplified production process, which reduces both resource needs and manufacturing waste. While no solution is entirely perfect, I believe the Monolith chair represents a significant step forward in sustainable furniture design and serves as a practical example of how innovative thinking can yield meaningful environmental benefits.\nIn summary, the Monolith chair is designed to influence the future of furniture design by demonstrating that simplicity and efficiency can drive sustainability. I hope it encourages other industry professionals to adopt similar practices, and inspires consumers to understand that less is more and to continue to support more sustainable design choices.",

        "text": "March is National Sleep Awareness Month, and March 10th is National Napping Day. Most workers put sleep at the bottom of the to-do list even though healthy sleep habits--like midday power naps--should be at the top because they boost brain health. Scientists say midday power naps improve mental alertness, energy and productivity, even the company’s bottom line. But most of us say we’re too busy for midday napping. Are you guilty? (I see a lot of hands, and I’m raising mine). But what if more of us started taking midday power naps? I see fewer raised hands, but I’m proudly raising mine.\nThe Benefits Of Midday Power Naps\nI’m one of those people who enjoys a midday snooze. It flips off my power switch and reboots my engine for the rest of the day. You, too, might find that power napping outweighs the benefits of chugging a Red Bull or drinking five cups of coffee to keep you alert and productive through the afternoon slump.\nSleeping on the job used to be frowned upon. But a Pew Research Center survey found that 34% of Americans take daily naps. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 30 minutes or less of catnapping can “restore alertness, enhance performance and reduce mistakes and accidents” in the workplace.\nIn the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy caught some extra z’s in early afternoon to keep up his stride. And NASA pilots take in-flight naps as short as 26 minutes to enhance performance and alertness by 34% and a 16% increase in reaction time.\nMore businesses have caught on to the healthy habit because of the benefits of alertness, reduction in errors and increased productivity. Companies are encouraging employees to take power naps at work. Some like Nike, Pizza Hut and Arianna Huffington’s Thrive Global even provide special rooms with specially designed chairs (called nap pods) for snoozing.\nStudies at the Salk Institute show that brain activity, memory and the power napper’s mood stays higher throughout the day compared to the brain activity of non-nappers, which declines as the day drags on. Another study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that people who power nap were 34% less likely to die from heart problems. Power naps are also great stress buffers. They lower stress by reducing the level of cortisol in your blood, refreshing you and refueling your engine. Here are seven advantages from the studies:\n1. Improves brain function\n2. Boosts ability to process and store information\n3. Sharpens alertness, reducing the frequency of errors and accidents\n4. Increases productivity\n5. Elevates Mood\n6. Lowers blood pressure and promotes healthy functioning of the heart\n7. Strengthens Memory\nThe Afternoon Crash And Benefits Of Midday Power Naps\nIf you’re like most American workers, you experience sudden dips in energy several hours into your workday--commonly known as the afternoon crash. These dips happen when you’ve overworked your brain, your mind wanders from your task at hand or at certain times of the day. Paychex surveyed 1,000 people about their work productivity and experiences with afternoon fatigue.\nThey found that the ideal window of productivity was between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. But 81% of employees experience the afternoon crash. Employees report experiencing the afternoon crash an average of 3.2 days per week, more than half of the workweek. The most effective ways workers combat the crash are drinking a caffeinated beverage (49%), taking a break (35%) and stretching (29%).\nThe Best Midday Power Naps To Improve Productivity\nIf you’re interested in reducing job stress and raising your productivity in the New Year, you might give the power nap a shot. Midday napping is not for everyone, and some people have trouble sleeping during the daytime. But for some, it’s the best thing since sliced bread. The ideal time to power nap is around two or three o’clock in the afternoon. Here are some steps to maximize the power nap benefits in 2025:\n1. Set an alarm. If you nap for more than 15 to 30 minutes, you might fall into deep sleep and wake up with a headache, feel groggy, or have difficulty sleeping later that night.\n2. Minimize disruptions. Turn off your electronic devices and nap in a quiet place. Consider using earplugs to ensure your full 15 minutes of uninterrupted sleep.\n3. Limit caffeine. If you plan to power down after lunch, avoid drinking a lot of coffee or energy drinks earlier in the day. Caffeine can prevent you from falling asleep unless you drink it right before dosing off.\n4. Be comfortable. Although some people sleep with their heads on their desks or lying back in an office chair, try sprawling out on an office sofa and use the cushion for your head. Make sure your supports are adequate and the room temperature is comfortable so that you can get to sleep right away.\n5. Darken the room. Too much light makes it difficult to power nap. Turn off the lights and draw the blinds—both of which creates enough darkness for sleep.\n6. Clear your mind. Make every effort to keep your power nap in a stress-free zone. Free your mind of any thoughts, worries or concerns, and tell yourself that this is your 15 or 30 minutes. You have the remainder of the day to deal with the other problems or unfinished business.\n7. Reboot gently. Some people wake from a power nap feeling sluggish, usually because they’ve slept too long. But if you’re disoriented, give yourself a few minutes to perk up. Rub your arms and thighs to feel back in your body and splash your face with cold water. Then you’re ready to embrace another few hours in the day.\nA Final Wrap On Midday Power Naps\nSleep is one of those things we often take for granted. Yet, it’s the most important remedy at our disposal, especially if you feel you’re stressed out in these troubling times. A good night’s sleep and a sound midday power nap are the foundations for our mental and physical health, job performance, productivity and career success.\nBut don’t catnap for too long. Limit naps to 30 minutes and before 3:00 in the afternoon for best results. Napping too long can interfere with nighttime sleep and lead to insomnia. Taking midday power naps earlier, instead of later, can actually help you sleep better at night.",

        "text": "As family offices evolve from wealth preservation vehicles to active investors, they’re creating powerful new dynamics in the entrepreneurial ecosystem that venture capitalists can't afford to ignore. This transformation represents both opportunity and challenge for the venture capital industry.\nThe Entrepreneurial Migration to Family Office Structures\nThe lines between entrepreneurship and family offices are increasingly blurring. UBS's Global Entrepreneur Report 2025 reveals that 31% of U.S. entrepreneurs surveyed plan to establish their own family office, signaling a significant shift in how successful founders are approaching wealth management and future investments.\n\"Entrepreneurs are increasingly interested in establishing family offices to manage their wealth strategically,\" notes Benjamin Cavalli, Head of Strategic Clients at UBS Global Wealth Management. This trend isn't surprising when considering the evolving profile of entrepreneurs experiencing liquidity events.\n\"What I find today is that entrepreneur's going through liquidity events are much younger than those monetizing in the past. Being that these entrepreneur's are builders, they want to continue building and creating. The family office can be the conduit through which they now make things happen. Post-liquidity event entrepreneurs, having now built up their human capital in how to build, now wish to take that acumen to multiple ventures. The family office is a way to help them scale their business building initiatives,\" explains Mark Tepsich, Family Office Design and Governance Strategist at UBS Family Office Solutions.\nToday's exiting founders typically view their exit not as retirement but as a launching pad for new ventures. Having built significant human capital through their entrepreneurial journey, they're leveraging family offices as platforms to scale their business-building initiatives across multiple domains.\n\"Entrepreneurs recognize that growing a business and managing investments require entirely different skill sets,\" the UBS report emphasizes, pointing to the increasing demand for specialized investment guidance that family offices can provide.\nPatient Capital: The Family Office Advantage\nUnlike traditional venture funds constrained by specific investment timelines and return expectations, family offices can deploy truly patient capital. This flexibility creates a distinct advantage for portfolio companies seeking sustainable growth rather than premature exits.\nAccording to UBS's findings, 74% of entrepreneurs plan to maintain their current risk levels in their investment portfolios over the next six months, suggesting a steadier, more long-term approach to capital deployment compared to institutional investors who may face pressure for quicker returns.\n\"I'm willing to take on more risk for the business than my personal investments. You want to seize that opportunity and for that reason, it is wise to take more risk in business,\" explains a materials handling and recycling entrepreneur from the Americas interviewed in the UBS report.\nThis patience extends beyond just financial runway. Family offices often bring a multigenerational perspective to investments, focusing on legacy impact that may take decades to fully realize—a stark contrast to the typical 7-10 year fund lifecycle of traditional venture capital.\nOperational Expertise: Beyond Just Capital\nPerhaps the most valuable asset family offices bring to venture investments isn't financial but operational. With deep industry knowledge and established networks, family office investors can provide startups with critical resources that extend far beyond funding.\n\"When we collaborate with family offices, we gain access to unique perspectives and sector-specific expertise,\" notes a Silicon Valley cybersecurity entrepreneur quoted in the UBS report, highlighting the mutual benefits these partnerships create.\nThis operational advantage is particularly powerful when family offices invest in areas where they have legacy expertise. The UBS data shows that 32% of entrepreneurs aim to focus on alternative business ventures beyond their core industries, creating opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas and approaches.\nThe Incubation Function: Lowering Barriers to Entry\nFamily offices are increasingly functioning as business incubators, providing infrastructure that significantly lowers barriers to entrepreneurship, especially for next-generation family members.\nThese offices can provide crucial back-office support—from incorporation and tax structuring to banking, accounting, HR, and insurance services—allowing new ventures to focus on product development and market entry without immediately building out administrative teams.\nOnce these ventures gain traction, they can gradually develop their own robust internal capabilities. This incubation function essentially transforms the family office from a wealth preservation vehicle to an entrepreneurial launchpad.\nGovernance Challenges in the New Paradigm\nAs family offices become more active in venture investing, governance becomes increasingly critical. Surprisingly, UBS's report reveals that only 55% of surveyed companies had clear succession plans for senior leadership.\n\"Succession planning is top of mind,\" says an Asia-Pacific entrepreneur who recently sold his gaming company. \"I've been spending a lot of time with the senior management, nurturing them to make the crucial business decisions on their own.\"\nFamily offices engaged in venture investing must establish clear governance frameworks that balance entrepreneurial risk-taking with wealth preservation objectives. Investment committees and external advisory boards can help maintain this balance while ensuring alignment between family values and investment strategies.\n\"Many entrepreneurs have not built up their private wealth as much as they could,\" observes a Swiss machining equipment entrepreneur interviewed for the UBS report, highlighting a common tendency to prioritize business reinvestment over wealth diversification.\nStrategic Implications for Venture Capitalists\nFor traditional VCs, the emergence of family offices as active venture investors presents both challenges and opportunities. To thrive in this evolving landscape, venture capitalists should consider several strategic adjustments:\n1. Develop Collaborative Models with Family Offices\nRather than viewing family offices as competitors, forward-thinking VCs are creating syndicates that leverage complementary strengths. Family offices bring industry expertise, patient capital, and operational resources, while VCs contribute deal flow, due diligence capabilities, and portfolio management expertise.\nThese collaborations can take various forms:\n- Co-investment structures where family offices participate alongside VC funds\n- Sector-specific partnerships targeting industries where the family has deep expertise\n- Advisory relationships where family office executives provide industry insights to VC teams\n2. Adjust Investment Horizons and Expectations\nVCs partnering with family offices must recognize and accommodate different time horizons. While traditional venture funds typically aim for exits within 5-7 years, family offices may be comfortable with significantly longer holding periods.\nThis divergence requires clear alignment of expectations at the outset of any partnership. Structured liquidity options—such as secondary sales or partial exits—can help bridge these different time horizons while maintaining collaborative relationships.\n3. Leverage Family Office Networks for Deal Sourcing\nFamily offices often have deep connections within specific industries that can yield proprietary deal flow. By cultivating relationships with family office investment teams, VCs can gain access to opportunities that might not appear in traditional startup ecosystems.\nThe UBS report indicates that 47% of entrepreneurs plan to engage in private equity or angel investing in the future, creating a growing network of sophisticated investors with unique deal access.\n4. Provide Value Beyond Capital\nIn a landscape where family offices can offer patient capital and operational expertise, traditional VCs must double down on their unique value propositions. This includes:\n- Specialized portfolio support services tailored to early-stage companies\n- Access to talent networks specifically designed for scaling organizations\n- Systematic approaches to later-stage fundraising and eventual exit opportunities\n\"Understanding the family’s ethos is key,\" advises an entrepreneur quoted in the UBS report, underscoring the importance of alignment between investors and founders beyond financial considerations.\nLooking Ahead: The Future of Family Office Venture Capital\nAs this intersection between family offices and entrepreneurship deepens, several trends bear watching:\nFirst, expect increasing professionalization of family office investment teams. As more entrepreneurs establish family offices, they bring sophisticated business building approaches to what were traditionally conservative wealth management structures.\nSecond, watch for new investment structures designed specifically for family office venture capital. These may include longer-duration funds, evergreen vehicles, and hybrid models that blend features of traditional VC with family office flexibility.\nFinally, anticipate evolution in the advisory ecosystem surrounding these entities. New service providers specializing in the family office-entrepreneurship nexus will emerge, offering expertise in areas from governance to specialized deal structuring.\nActionable Takeaways for Venture Capitalists\nFor VCs seeking to thrive in this evolving landscape, several concrete actions can position them for success:\n- Map your existing LP base for family office connections that could yield strategic collaborations beyond capital.\n- Consider launching specialized fund vehicles with terms tailored to family office investors, potentially including longer duration periods or flexible liquidity options.\n- Develop industry-specific value propositions for family offices with legacy expertise in particular sectors.\n- Create transparent co-investment frameworks that clearly define roles, expectations, and governance mechanisms when partnering with family offices on deals.\n- Build educational resources for family offices new to venture investing, positioning your firm as a trusted advisor in this growing space.\nThe intersection of family offices and entrepreneurship represents far more than a new source of capital for startups—it signals a fundamental transformation in how private wealth flows through the innovation ecosystem. For venture capitalists who recognize and adapt to this shift, it offers unprecedented opportunities to create value through new forms of collaboration with some of the world's most sophisticated private investors.",

        "text": "Shipping products to buyers both domestically and internationally is a lucrative way to expand your business income, but navigating shipping fees and regulations can be challenging. Below are several options for fast and affordable shipping solutions to satisfy your customers worldwide.\n1. Multi-Carrier Shipping Manager Software\nOverpaying for shipping is a common mistake, as comparing rates between carriers is time-consuming and potentially confusing. Choosing the right shipping software can make a world of difference in quickly managing unshipped orders and calculating postage costs.\nFor example, many artists, resellers, and businesses rely on Rollo for all-in-one integration because the platform doesn’t require monthly fees or minimum volumes. Additionally, business owners can quickly print labels with competitive shipping discounts without having to buy proprietary labels or hardware to use the shipping software.\nThe free Rollo Ship platform, available for iOS, Android, and desktop, automatically integrates with the largest eCommerce websites, including Amazon, eBay, Magento, Poshmark, Shopify, and Walmart Marketplace. It also doesn’t require minimum volume requirements or a monthly fee.\nShipping software perks include:\n- Discounted shipping rates: Rates up to 90% lower than the public retail rates for multiple couriers. It’s also easy to compare shipping discounts by cheapest, fastest, or premium service.\n- Bulk shipping: Shipping software can group your orders across all selling channels by comparing rates and transit times. This convenience also saves plenty of time by automating administrative tasks.\n- Shipping presets: For frequently sold items, you can easily compare the latest rates for specific product dimensions, package weight, and destination.\n- Online store integration: Use a single platform to manage your orders and sync shipping across multiple eCommerce channels, including dropship transactions.\n- Scheduled pickups: Coordinate with carriers to have them pick up your order directly from your home or business with a few button clicks. Further, track shipments and handle delays regardless of the carrier or selling platform.\n- Inventory management: View real-time quantities, reserve inventory for unshipped orders, and receive low-stock or out-of-stock alerts.\n- Hands-on support: Whether you ship a handful of items each month or hundreds per week, there will be instances when platform or shipping issues need to be resolved. A helpful customer support team can provide quick solutions.\nIn addition to the shipping benefits, the platform has a free label designer with over 500 templates. It’s beginner-friendly and can print from any device and printer using any label brand.\nMoreover, using budget-friendly software doesn’t mean sacrificing customer service quality.\n“One of the greatest joys is connecting with our customers and seeing the unique items they’re shipping. One moment it’s freshly baked cookies, the next it’s rare vintage industrial treasures,” says Stephanie Espolt, marketing manager at Rollo.\nEspolt continues, “Every now and then, we get a call from a business owner who needs to ship their order today, before the shipping cut-off time, and their computer is acting up. To be able to jump in and either initiate or restore a smooth shipping process is deeply satisfying to our team. We have provided not just a printer but an ongoing experience. Now the customer has one less thing to worry about.”\n2. Invest in a Thermal Label Printer\nSellers shipping their own inventory can also save time and money with a high-end thermal printer. Sellers can notably reduce packaging costs thanks to its budget-friendly startup costs and maintenance-free usage.\nFirst, this eco-friendly technology doesn’t require ink or toner cartridges which can be expensive and a hassle to replace. Instead, the printhead imprints the shipping label using heat and can produce thousands of labels virtually maintenance-free.\nFor instance, AirPrint and Wi-Fi-friendly shipping label printers from Rollo cost less than $300 and are compatible with any operating system. USB thermal label printers are also available at a lower cost.\nThese printers can provide a frustration-free shipping experience in several ways:\n- Easy setup and update: Set up within minutes and receive over-the-air updates\n- Low maintenance: Ink-free printing and fewer moving parts than traditional printers reduce ongoing costs and upkeep\n- Intelligent label detection: Auto-detect shipping label sizes across multiple online stores without the need for manual cropping.\n- All-in-one shipping labels: Compatible with any brand or size, such as 4x6, 2x1, and 2 inches. Thermal printers can also handle barcode labels, round labels, and decorative labels.\nFurther, adhesive thermal shipping labels typically cost noticeably less than similar laser printer labels. Since thermal labels are adhesive, packaging tape costs are eliminated in addition to ink or toner.\nResearch studies indicate businesses are adopting this cost-cutting measure with a 5% annual growth rate per year. Specifically, the thermal printing industry is estimated to grow from $42.96 billion to $58.59 billion in 2030 as sellers shift away from resource-intensive ink printers.\nCoupling shipping discounts with the ability to print shipping labels at a sharply lower cost are the most effective ways to boost profits and\nHigh-volume shippers will reap the highest savings potential, although low-volume sellers can also benefit from the convenience.\n3. Purchase Shipping Insurance\nShipping insurance plays an increasingly prominent role in minimizing potential losses from counterfeit, missing, stolen, and damaged products. Increased shipping volumes raise the likelihood of mishaps that erode a seller’s profit margins.\nIn fact, UPS Capital’s 2024 Mid-Year Guide to Shipping Excellence states that nearly 99% of merchants utilize insurance to minimize replacement costs.\nIn addition to carrier-provided coverage, sellers may consider buying a blanket policy from independent providers to cover multiple deliveries at a more affordable price than per-label insurance purchases.\nCompare carrier and third-party policy costs for similar coverage limits. Price quotes can vary from 20% to 50% between providers. It’s also worth comparing claim filing windows and minimum waiting periods to receive reimbursement as soon as possible.\nIf it’s necessary to file a claim, remember that it’s worth contacting the customer support team of the shipping software used to produce the label. The agents can help sellers navigate the claims process.\n4. Use Multiple Warehouses\nMulti-warehousing inventory helps achieve ideal shipping speeds and costs. This e-commerce fulfillment strategy also reduces supply chain risk and can solidify sustainable business growth.\nOnce again, multi-partner shipping apps manage pending orders and can delegate dropshipping tasks to the nearest warehouse. The on-site staff prints shipping labels and packages the merchandise, requiring only the owner to handle administrative work.\nOutsourcing shipping and logistics to a fourth-party logistics (4PL) or third-party logistics (3PL) provider eliminates communication barriers and ensures the availability of warehouse storage space and dedicated order fulfillment resources.\nAn excellent shipping indicator is that eMarketer projects global e-commerce revenues to grow by 7% year-over-year through 2030 as more households around the world rely on internet sellers to deliver the items they need.\nThe incrementally higher sales volumes can lead to more competitive rates. It can also require innovative solutions to accomplish customer satisfaction.\n5. Hire a Customs Broker\nCross-border transactions increase the probability of shipping delays at ports of entry and congested shipping lanes. Certain types of merchandise are more susceptible to delays, tariffs, and legal issues.\nWhile not every international seller benefits from this solution, hiring a customs broker can help smooth out these logistical headaches. The broker is your legal representative to help clear the customs process sooner, satisfy compliance audits, and work with local logistics providers to confirm timely delivery.\nCustom brokers play an essential role in shipping high-value items, time-sensitive inventory, or products with confusing classification codes.\nThese experts can be more efficient at:\n- Accurately calculating taxes and tariffs\n- Proper product classifications using Harmonized Systems (HS) codes\n- Researching regulations\n- Understanding local customs and procedures\nWhen comparing brokers, consider their certifications, regional expertise, and technology use. Many offer real-time communication with shippers for optimal transparency.\nFinal Thoughts\nChoosing an all-in-one shipping and label printer platform can be the easiest way for the average shipper and current USPS, FedEx, and UPS clients to streamline their operations and trim overhead expenses. More advanced solutions become beneficial with high-value or time-sensitive shipments.\nRelated Articles:",

        "text": "Topline\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy told members of Congress on Thursday he signed a deal with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency that will allow DOGE officials to start reviewing the U.S. Postal Service for potential cuts—potentially foreshadowing major changes to USPS amid reports Trump wants to overhaul the agency.\nKey Facts\nDeJoy signed a deal Wednesday with the General Services Administration and DOGE to “assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies,” the postmaster general said in a letter to lawmakers Thursday, saying he was “happy to have others assist us in our worthwhile cause.”\nDeJoy is a Republican who has long sparked controversy at the agency for imposing cost-cutting moves, which critics have argued has resulted in mail delays and other cuts to service.\nThe postmaster general asked lawmakers to review a list of proposed areas that he asked DOGE officials to help with, including making changes to workers benefits and the Postal Regulatory Commission that oversees the regulations governing USPS.\nMost notably, DeJoy said he asked DOGE to review the “unfunded mandates” that Congress has forced USPS to follow, which include the agency’s obligation to deliver mail six days a week, maintain post offices in rural areas, have uniform rates for first-class mail and provide free P.O. boxes to residents whose homes are not served by mail carriers.\nDeJoy’s letter comes after The Washington Post reported Feb. 20 President Donald Trump wants to fire USPS’ board of directors and move the agency to be under the Department of Commerce—potentially the first step toward trying to privatize USPS, which Trump has long floated and reportedly discussed with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick ahead of his inauguration.\nUSPS and the White House have not yet responded to requests for comments about what DeJoy’s agreement could mean for the Postal Service.\nWhat To Watch For\nIt’s still unclear what will happen to USPS and to what extent DOGE will try to make cuts at the agency. Any efforts to cut service or for Trump to change the agency’s structure are also likely to result in court challenges. Experts cited by The Post suggest Trump moving USPS to the Department of Commerce via executive order would violate federal law, and the mandates requiring USPS to deliver mail to all Americans six days a week were passed by Congress, so Trump and DOGE could not unilaterally get rid of any of those requirements without lawmakers’ support. Trump’s plans could also face opposition in Congress, as though GOP lawmakers have typically been very willing to support the president’s policy goals, many lawmakers who represent rural areas have historically been critical of any cuts to the agency that affect their constituents’ service.\nChief Critic\nRep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., accused DeJoy on Thursday of turning over USPS to Musk and DOGE “so they can undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans’ loss,” saying any cuts will particularly hurt “those in rural and hard to reach areas—who rely on the Postal Service every day to deliver mail, medications, ballots, and more.” “Reliable mail delivery can’t just be reserved for MAGA supporters and Tesla owners,” the lawmaker said.\nWhat Has Trump Said About Usps?\nTrump suggested in December he was open to privatizing USPS, saying it was “not the worst idea I’ve ever heard” and his team was “looking at it.” The president has more recently signaled trying to bring USPS under the Commerce Department, saying in February Lutnick is “looking at” the mail agency and floating “a kind of merger” between the two agencies. “We think we can turn it around,” Trump said. Trump has long been a critic of USPS in its current form, repeatedly decrying the agency during his first term and suggesting it should raise its prices. The president called USPS a “joke” in April 2020, claiming,“If they raised the price of a package by approximately four times, it would be a whole new ballgame.”\nWhat Happens If Usps Is Privatized?\nShould Trump fulfill his longtime goal of privatizing USPS—which he floated in his first term but never followed through with—the biggest changes would likely be to mail delivery in rural areas, which would be the most affected by any cuts to service. USPS currently handles “last-mile delivery” for Amazon and other private shipping companies to carry packages to out-of-the-way houses that are more expensive to deliver to, on top of its mandates to provide service six days a week in all areas and operate rural services. Any privatization of USPS could result in people in rural areas facing higher costs for less frequent deliveries, according to experts cited by CNN. Postal worker unions have also warned employees’ jobs could be less stable in a privatized USPS, noting it would likely end the unions’ existing contracts with the agency and retirement benefits, along with other job protections. Proponents of privatization have suggested it could help USPS’ long-running financial issues, as it would mean the agency would now be able to accept private capital funds and raise prices, rather than remain reliant on government loans. It could allow the Postal Service to innovate more and implement better technology than when it’s subject to a lower budget and governmental scrutiny, proponents have argued.\nWho Will Replace Louis Dejoy?\nDeJoy’s letter about DOGE’s involvement at USPS comes as the postmaster general is preparing to depart the agency, telling USPS’ board of governors in February he planned to step down. DeJoy garnered widespread controversy from the left during his first term, as he instituted cuts that sparked mail delays and led Democrats to accuse him of intentionally trying to stymie mail-in voting in the 2020 election to benefit Trump. The Post reports Trump and Republicans have soured on DeJoy more recently, however, because of his willingness to work with the Biden administration on things like sending out COVID-19 tests to Americans and efforts to facilitate mail-in voting, which Trump has long opposed. No replacement has yet been named for DeJoy, and Trump will not appoint his successor, as it’s instead up to the board of governors to appoint and confirm the postmaster general. The Post reported Trump’s transition team was vetting potential successors to DeJoy, however, believing Trump could appoint enough loyalists to fill vacancies on USPS’ board to get his chosen postmaster general confirmed. Those in contention for the role as of January reportedly include Postal Regulatory Commission vice chair Robert Taub, former USPS exec Thomas Day and Jim Cochrane, head of the Package Shippers Association trade group that represents private shipping companies like Amazon and FedEx.\nKey Background\nWhile it falls under the scope of the federal government, USPS is largely not funded by taxpayers and has to generate its own revenue, and the agency has long faced financial issues as a result. DeJoy came to USPS in 2020 from the private sector, vowing to shake up the agency and impose cost-cutting measures that would ease its financial woes. That led to the changes that ultimately sparked mail delays before the 2020 election—which courts ordered him to reverse—and DeJoy imposing a 10-year plan that critics have argued results in less reliable and less frequent service. Musk and DOGE’s involvement with USPS comes as the billionaire and his associates have made their way through the federal government, imposing widespread cuts and mass firings of workers, dismantling agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and threatening cuts at the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service and more.\nFurther Reading\nTrump expected to take control of USPS, fire postal board, officials say (Washington Post)",

        "title": "New ‘Asian Comics’ Exhibit Offers A Deep Dive Into A Rich Visual Culture",
        "created_at": "2025-03-13",
        "description": "An unprecedented collection of art and artifacts from across Asia defies expectations in presenting a rich, complex story.",

        "text": "Asian comics, especially Japanese manga and South Korean webtoons, are read by hundreds of millions worldwide and are the driving force in a fast-growing global market estimated at nearly $14 billion in 2023. They power movies, anime series, games, fashion, cosplay and licensed merchandise worth exponentially more. But relatively few westerners are aware of the long history and unique culture of comics across Asia that underlies this mass commercial phenomenon.\nA travelling exhibition, Asian Comics: The Evolution of An Art Form, that just opened at the Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP) in Seattle goes a long way toward closing that gap. Curated by British comics scholar Paul Gravett, and based on his 2018 book Mangasia, the Asian Comics exhibit offers a panoramic tour of visual storytelling from Japan to India and all points in between, emphasizing the stylistic and thematic diversity that has emerged over more than a century of development.\nThe exhibit is organized by topic – mythology, history, slice of life, imaginative fiction and erotica – with art and artifacts from Japan, China, North and South Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere presented side by side to demonstrate similarities and differences in approach from culture to culture.\nFans looking for crowd-pleasing contemporary work will be disappointed. There is no Sailor Moon, Pokémon or Demon Hunter to be found, and the only example of the mega-popular Dragonball franchise is an original issue of the first run from the 1980s nestled in a cluster of material dealing with the monkey-trickster theme. Sharp-eyed fans of One Piece will spot a facsimile of a page of artwork from the first chapter. Filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, who began his career creating manga and is perhaps the most popular storyteller in this tradition in the world, is not part of this particular story. Whatever this show may be, it is not a “greatest hits” collection.\nInstead, the exhibit rewards close attention, presenting gorgeous hand-drawn and hand-painted original art for the comics, which has rarely been exhibited anywhere, alongside vintage publications, tear-sheets of Sunday comics, thick manga anthologies and pocket-sized tankōbon. There are stills and storyboards from media adaptations, fashions, a replica art studio (both digital and traditional) and an interactive feature that allows visitors to control the actions of an onscreen mech robot using poses and gestures.\nThe text tracks the development of comics as both a means of expression and a commercial industry from the late 19th century to the current day. It explores the impact of colonialism, insurgency and revolutionary conflict on the art, showing how comics dealt with Japanese imperialism, the atomic bombs, the Korean and Vietnam wars, and the Cambodian genocide, some of the most traumatic events of recent history. All the exhibits are extensively annotated, although it can be difficult to follow the sequence due to MoPOP’s labyrinthine gallery layout. It is possible to miss the upper floor, containing the more accessible fashion, erotica and media exhibits, altogether without a guide or map.\nThe vast ambition of the show means that a lot of material is packed into a small space. A visit could easily take hours if you read all the text and closely observe all the displayed items. But if you don’t invest a certain amount of effort, you’re likely to leave a bit confused by the large number of comics traditions and styles that are represented, or come away without much of a deeper understanding of ‘Asian comics’ as a unified concept. Fortunately Gravett’s book is available in the gift shop.\nThe exhibition, produced by Barbican, debuted in Rome in 2017, made two other stops in Europe, and was previously at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, CA. It is running at MoPOP through January 4, 2026.",

        "text": "On Feb. 25, an elite Russian drone group—the Rubicon Center of Advanced Unmanned Systems—launched a devastating wave of attacks on the main supply line supporting the Ukrainian garrison in Sudzha, the center of the Ukrainian-held salient in western Russia’s Kursk Oblast.\nEmploying what analyst Andrew Perpetua described as “advanced drone tactics” including elaborate ambushes involving multiple explosive drones “striking the front, back and sides of a vehicle almost simultaneously,” Rubicon swiftly knocked out hundreds of Ukrainian vehicles.\nIt was “the day you started worrying about Kursk,” Perpetua wrote. Two weeks later on Monday or Tuesday, the Ukrainian force—10,000 troops in multiple heavy brigades—slipped out of Kursk.\nStarving for supplies and in danger of being cut off, the retreating Ukrainians moved quickly, apparently under the cover of darkness. Whatever heavy equipment they couldn’t take with them, they simply abandoned—effectively leaving them for the Russians to seize.\nThe prizes included some of the best vehicles and artillery belonging to some of Ukraine’s best brigades.\nM-1 Abrams tank\nUnder former President Joe Biden, the United States donated 31 of the 69-ton, four-person M-1s—each thickly armored and armed with an accurate 120-millimeter gun—to Ukraine in 2023. The tanks equipped a single battalion in the elite 47th Mechanized Brigade, whose battalions have fought practically non-stop in southern and eastern Ukraine for nearly two years.\nFighting aggressively, frequently on the attack, the 47th Mechanized Brigade often found itself abandoning damaged M-1s in the contested no-man’s-land between Ukrainian and Russian lines, complicating efforts to recover the multi-million-dollar tanks. So it should come as no surprise that, as the brigade fled Kursk, it left behind another damaged Abrams ... and the Russians captured it.\nThe loss brings the 47th Mechanized Brigade’s M-1 losses to at least 10 and as many as 19. Fortunately for the brigade, 49 fresh M-1s are coming soon from Australian army surplus.\nM-2 Bradley fighting vehicle\nThe 33-ton, 10-person M-2 may be the best fighting vehicle of the Russia-Ukraine war. With its balanced combination of mobility, protection and firepower—thanks to its fast-firing 25-millimeter autocannon.\nThe Biden administration sent more than 300 Bradleys to Ukraine, and the Ukrainians distributed them to at least six 31-vehicle battalions, including several with the 47th Mechanized Brigade. The units have fought hard on the offense and defense across Ukraine—and, before this week, had written off at least 80 of their beloved Brads.\nThe example captured in Kursk might be the 81st.\nWorse for the Ukrainians, no more Bradleys are coming unless the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump pledges additional copies from U.S. Army surplus.\nConsidering that Trump temporarily halted all U.S. aid to Ukraine following a disastrous Feb. 28 press conference in the Oval Office, during which he and Vice President J.D. Vance absurdly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for being insufficiently grateful for the weapons and other aid Biden sent to Ukraine—including the M-2s—those Ukrainian battalions shouldn’t hold their breath.\nM-777 howitzer\nThe arrival of the first U.K.-made M-777 howitzer in Ukraine in the spring of 2022 was a turning point for the embattled country. It marked the slow transition of Ukraine’s outgunned artillery corps from outdated ex-Soviet guns and shells to the latest Western guns and shells.\nA 4.5-ton M-777 can fire an unguided shell out to a distance of up to 19 miles. That’s several miles farther than a 152-millimeter, ex-Soviet 2S3 can fire. In all, the Ukrainians have received around 200 M-777s and used them all along the 800-mile front line.\nBut their ubiquity exposes them to the full range of Russian counterbattery fire—and their importance makes them priority targets. In 37 months of hard fighting, culminating in the grinding battle in Kursk, the Ukrainians have lost at least 55 M-777s. The gun the Russians captured while retaking the oblast may be the first intact M-777 in Russian hands.\nIn all, the Ukrainians lost around 500 vehicles and other heavy equipment in Kursk. The Russians lost around 600.\nWhile that might seem like a win of sorts for Ukraine, Russia can spare much more equipment than Ukraine can. Ukrainian commanders try to maintain a three-to-one loss ratio in their favor—a ratio they obviously failed to maintain in attempting, and ultimately failing, to hang on in Kursk.",

        "text": "Kelly Church’s Native Land Mat (2024) seems simple enough. It’s not big, or flashy, or colorful. It doesn’t shout from the wall, more of a “psst.”\nThe Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi/Ottawa artist’s white cedar bark, black ash, ribbon, wood, and laminated black construction paper artwork would be easy to pass by without a second glance when visiting “Art for Zhegagoynak/Chicagoland” through July 13, 2025, at The Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. Before passing by, however, be sure to look down to read this illuminated message: “YOU ARE ON NATIVE LAND.”\nChurch’s (b. 1967) mat is a welcome mat. The kind commonly found at front doors across America. Church is welcoming visitors to Native land.\nYes, sprawling Chicagoland is Native land. Same as every other square inch of the United States. Before inventing the skyscraper, Chicago was the traditional homeland of the people of the Council of Three Fires—the Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Odawa—as well as the Menominee, Miami, Ho-Chunk, Sac, Fox, Kickapoo, and Illinois nations. It has been a longstanding cultural and economic hub for Indigenous peoples and continues to be today.\n“(Native Land Mat is) foundational to the exhibition, highlighting not just the presence, but the responsibility behind what it means to be on Native land at all times,” Jordan Poorman Cocker (Kiowa), Terra Foundation guest co-curator of the exhibition, told Forbes.com. “(Church) said in our artist panel that you're always on Native land. When you go to sleep, you're on Native land. When you go to work (you’re on Native land). I love that she brought out something that's very simple and intuitive within many of our (Native) communities, that simple fact.”\nLand. Place. Home.\n“There is no separation between the people and the place,” Jason Wesaw (b. 1974; Pokagon Band of Potawatomi) told Forbes.com.\nWesaw and Church along with Andrea Carlson (b. 1979; Grand Portage Ojibwe/European descent) and Nora Moore Lloyd (b. 1947: Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe) are the four collaborating artists with connections to Zhegagoynak responsible for helping produce “Woven Being.”\n“If you look around many areas in this entire country, but specifically in the Chicagoland region, you'll see evidence of our people in street names, town names, lake names, river names,” Wesaw continued. “It's profound to me how our influence is there, but people don't associate the language with the people. I feel like when people see our art, they see a reflection of us as Indian people, but when they see a reflection of us, it's my hope that they also see a reflection of the land, because everything of what we are as Potawatomi people, as Native people, it really comes to us from our connection to the natural world.”\nMenomonee Street. Waukegan. Pistakee Lake. Somonauk Creek.\n“My people have been in the Chicagoland region for many thousands of years so we have very, very deep roots, and putting a lens of contemporary art onto our culture and telling those stories in that way freshens them up and gives people a different perspective than perhaps what they've ever been able to experience,” Wesaw added.\nArt for Zhegagoynak\nTo be clear, “Art for Zhegagoynak/Chicagoland” is an art exhibition, not an ethnographic or historic exhibition. Art. Contemporary art.\n“It's important to think about this exhibition as not just an Indigenous art show, but as a fine arts exhibition” Poorman Cocker said. “We talked early on with the four artists who informed our curatorial decision making through this process of asking them who influenced you, who are your heroes and or sheroes.”\nTheir list didn’t only include Native artists.\n“One of the things that's cool about the presence of the work by Barnett Newman and Agnes Martin and Joseph Albers is how it flips the script,” Kathleen Bickford Berzock, exhibition co-curator and Block associate director of curatorial affairs, told Forbes.com. “We're so conditioned to walk into an encyclopedic art museum and see an exhibition by an artist like that and maybe there's a single work by an unnamed Native artist put there to contextualize their interest in Native art of some kind. In ‘Woven Being,’ we've said the same thing (in reverse). Some of the artists represented in this exhibition see their work being in dialog with (Newman, Martin, and Albers.)”\nNative American artists are American artists, too, despite their historic remove from it by scholars, museums, galleries, and collectors.\n“Going to museums growing up and investigating my own curiosities about art and who the masters were, I never saw people of from my own community and stories from our perspective,” Wesaw said. “When I would go into these great institutions, the masters, for the most part, were of European descent, and 99% male. I wondered why works of indigenous people were not held in the same regard. I felt the power of the artworks that were created in my community by mentors and teachers and relatives of mine, but I would never see anything like the beautiful black ash basket in ‘Woven Being’ by my elder John Pigeon. I would never see a work of art like that in a contemporary art museum, and I always felt like our works belonged next to those folks considered modern masters.”\nAll the Native artists in “Woven Being” deserve canonical recognition and consideration beyond the “Native art” silo. Ancestor modern masters in the show include Rick Bartow, Woodrow Wilson Crumbo, Jim Denomie, and George Morrison; living masters include Frank Big Bear, Jeffrey Gibson, Teri Greeves, and Virgil Ortiz.\n“As this show was being hung and put together, there were all these synchronicities and these conversations that were going on between the individual artworks that no matter how many discussions we had over the years, or no matter how hard we tried, I don't think we could have made some of those things happen,” Wesaw said. “There's an obvious spirit contained within the show that revealed itself the way that it needed to be revealed, regardless of what we were trying to do as curators, collaborators and artists, and I think that's evident in some of the works by the non-Native artists and the way that they're in this beautiful conversation with the works around them.”\nIndigenous Chicago\n“Woven Being” seeks to enhance understanding of Chicago by seeing it through Indigenous perspectives. Understandings like how Evanston namesake, Northwestern University founder, and four-decade NU Board of Trustees chair John Evans was connected to the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre where U.S. Army cavalry soldiers slaughtered approximately 150 Cheyenne and Arapaho, most of them women and children.\nUnderstandings like how long before Chicago was remarkable for tall buildings, Chicagoland was remarkable for tall grass. The entirety of Illinois was at one time tallgrass prairie, an ecosystem so rich and diverse with plants and insects and birds and mammals as to make the Garden of Eden look like an abandoned lot on Halsted Street. Carlson’s 15-plus-foot-long The Indifference of Fire (2023) reminds visitors this landscape was once managed by Native people, by fire–‘ishkode’ in Ojibwe–for thousands of years before it was destroyed by that “Great” Chicago fire.\n“You can't really support folks that you don't know, and this exhibition does a beautiful job of breaking down some of the barriers through these gorgeous works of fine art around what's known about the region, what's known about the land, what's known about the water, and a little bit about the folks who have called this place home for many generations,” Poorman Croker said. “One of those barriers, especially in urban spaces, is invisibility. There are folks in communities who don't know Native Americans still exist, which is strange from my perspective, but the gaps in our educational system around indigenous histories, continuity, and vitality definitely impact that understanding.”\nTribal nations covered Illinois before the U.S. government pushed them out and stole their land. Then, beginning in the 1950s, another effort to separate Indigenous people from their land, culture, and heritage, brought Native people from around the country to Chicago. Chicago was a hub for urban Indian relocation.\nThe museum’s location brings extra weight to these overlooked or omitted histories.\n“Northwestern and the Block Museum are within walking distance of Lake Michigan, and understanding how that place is an indigenous space changes the way that I personally see where I live and where I work, and I think that's one of the things that this show can do for people who don't have that indigenous perspective,” Bickford Berzock, a 30 year Chicago resident, said.\nWeesaw lives on the Michigan side of Lake Michigan. His people refer to the Lake as Kchegmé, large body of water.\n“My people did not differentiate the five Great Lakes, rather we knew them as one large, connected body of water, separate from the oceans, rivers, and inland lakes,” Weesaw explains. “Kche (big or large) gmé (water) and put them together: Kchegmé. Interestingly, early explorers and map makers translated what they heard as mshegmé, which eventually was changed even further into how we know the water and state in the present day: Michigan.”\nWeesaw produced an installation for “Woven Being” replicating lake life.\n“It's common when you're sitting and listening to those waves coming up and feeling that breeze, there's something about it that really connects you as a human being to something larger than our own self,” he explained of his Water Carries Memory. “That work was really satisfying to bring to completion because it's my hope that people are going to find a peaceful, introspective place as they sit and look at the work. I don't need them to think about indigenous perspectives or history or what wrongs need to be righted. I need them to understand that they have a beautiful place in this world that is dependent upon them understanding where they fit into that circle of life, that human beings aren't at the top of some pyramid, but we're merely a part of so many other things going on around us, and it's good to observe those things.”\nAdmission to The Block Museum of Art is always free.",

        "text": "All eyes are on Russian President Vladimir Putin at the moment. But what does Putin see when he looks at the world?\nTwo weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he didn’t have ‘the cards’. This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ‘the ball’ is in Russia’s court. And when Western media write about the 30-day cease-fire proposal from the United States and Ukraine, they speculate that Putin is likely to ‘play’ for more time.\nBut what happens when we talk about strategically high-tension situations like a game? And why did Zelensky insist on talking about the war differently when he met with Trump at the White House, saying, \"I'm not playing cards. I'm very serious, Mr. President. I'm very serious\"?\nHere are 3 reasons why leaders – political as well as corporate – should stop talking about themselves and others as players in a game.\nPutin Doesn’t Like To Lose – Neither Does Anyone Else\nTelling Putin that the ball is in Russia’s court is the same as saying it’s his turn to take a shot. But that's not what anyone wants. On the contrary, the whole idea of a temporary ceasefire is for everyone to stop shooting.\nThe war must be put on hold so that the parties can talk to each other without fear of losing ground. But talking about balls instead of bullets does not eliminate the fear of losing. Rather, it sends a clear message that there will be winners and losers. And that the next shot is crucial to who becomes what.\nOnly Putin knows what he sees when he looks at the world. But we all know what it’s like to lose. And we don’t like it. So when the world asks us to play, we play to win.\nHowever, a ceasefire is not about winning. Or losing. It’s about replacing the winner-loser mindset with something else. Something that makes us realize that no matter how clearly the world appears to us, there are others who see it differently.\nPutin Is Being Serious – So Should Everyone Else\nWhen Trump said Zelensky didn’t have the cards, Zelensky insisted that he is not playing cards: “I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious.” But why was it so important for Zelensky to emphasize that he is not playing cards?\nWhile a game of cards is something you do for fun for an hour or two, the war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for more than 3 years and there has been nothing fun about it. Moreover, the two countries share a history that works directly against Trump’s repeated “we have to get this over with quickly.”\nSolving “the root causes” of the Russian invasion – which Putin says is necessary for him to support the idea behind a U.S.-backed ceasefire – is not something you do overnight. And comparing it to playing cards is the opposite of being serious.\nTo take our negotiating partners – and ourselves – seriously, we must stop talking about ‘cards’ and ‘balls’ and start talking about the change we want to see in the world.\nAnd if we insist on staying in the ‘game’, we must do like Russian chess grandmaster, Garry Kasparov, who said this when asked about Putin, Trump and political strategy in 2019:\n“My mother told me that the game of chess is not just about winning or losing. Of course, it’s about winning, but the most important thing is to make the difference. So you play the game, you come up with new ideas, you can always push the horizon, so you create new ideas, you sort of improve the game and the understanding of the game. And since I left chess, I followed the same rule. It’s about making the difference.”\nPutin Must Make A Choice – So Must Everyone Else\nWhen faced with a tough question, we have a choice. And it is not the choice that the Western media are putting forward. The choice Putin has to make is not first and foremost whether or not to sign the truce. It is how he wants to respond.\nBeing asked a tough question comes with a responsibility to respond. But the act of responding can take different forms. More precisely, we can respond by:\n- Re-acting to the question (confirm or deny the terms)\n- Inter-acting with the questioner (negotiate the terms), or\n- Pro-actively asking a new question (redefine the terms)\nThe difference between reacting, interacting and proactively changing the rules is not a matter of what leaders say, or how convincingly they say it. It’s a matter of why they say and do the things they do: The mindset they have when entering strategic conversations. Their intention to either,\n- Answer other people’s questions with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’\n- Exchange questions and answers to reach a common goal, or\n- Ask their own questions to get others to say ‘yes’\nNo matter what Putin says, and how convincingly he says it, it’s his mindset and intentions that determine how the war will proceed. And taking these intentions seriously, while staying true to their own, is what his negotiating partners need to succeed. Not to think and talk about the war as a game.",

        "text": "The Trump Administration has taken multiple steps that risk permanently damaging or eliminating important federal data sources. And senior current and former government officials as well as researchers worry that more serious threats are on the horizon, including to critical information that is key to informing tax policy.\nWhy should the public care? Because those data can help explain everything from burgeoning health risks to changes in weather, inflation, and employment. They provide important information about the tax system as well as the effectiveness of government programs such as education assistance, Medicare, and Social Security.\nPart Of A Broader Effort\nSuppression of tax data is not new. The Tax Policy Center was created more than two decades ago after the Treasury Department in both Democratic and Republican administrations began limiting the information it released on the distributional effects of tax proposals.\nHowever, the magnitude of the threat to data collection and analysis may be unprecedented. In recent weeks the Administration has:\n- Shuttered a long-standing Social Security Administration project aimed at studying retirement issues.\n- Temporarily blocked the Centers for Disease Control from releasing weekly reports on disease in the US and a wide range of other health-related information. While the disease report was reinstated, other CDC data on current health issues remain inaccessible. At the same time, CDC reportedly is limiting the ability of staff to publish research in academic journals.\n- Announced it may delete government spending from regular reports on Gross Domestic Product, which describes the overall state of the economy.\n- Disbanded five groups of outside experts that advise government on data collection and dissemination and that serve, in important ways, as independent watchdogs.\n- Largely shuttered the research arm of the Department of Education\nEffects On Tax Data\nAt IRS and Treasury, layoffs, resignations, and retirements will limit their capacity to collect and analyze tax data. According to published reports, the IRS already has fired about 7,000 employees, many others have resigned or retired, and the Administration reportedly plans to eliminate as many as 20 percent of all IRS jobs.\nAlready, the agency’s Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics Division lost more than 10 percent of its staff when probationary employees were fired in February. They included data scientists, economists, statisticians, and computer specialists.\nBecause of the magnitude of staffing cuts alone, projects will likely have to be abandoned. Cuts could come in programs such as Statistics of Income (SOI), which provides the most detailed information publicly available on, for example, overall deductions, credits, and sources of income.\nRegardless of staffing, President Trump’s January 20 executive order terminating all federal programs related to “diversity, equity and inclusion” has halted IRS studies of how the revenue code and tax administration affect Black, Asian, and Hispanic households.\nFuture Worries\nBased on what already has happened at other agencies, data experts tell me they worry that entire research programs at IRS and Treasury may be eliminated, specific studies may be stopped, or results suppressed.\nReports and studies that once were made widely available may no longer be open to the public. The Trump White House has a history of censuring data for political purposes.\nFor example, in the first Trump Administration Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asserted a staff study found the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) would pay for itself but the study he claimed supported that conclusion was never released.\nLooking ahead, will there be pressure to suppress statistics that show declines in customer service such as longer telephone wait times or reduced revenue collections due to staffing cuts? What about decreases in taxes paid by higher-income taxpayers, or increases in taxes paid by lower-income taxpayers?\nWhat will happen to cooperative agreements between IRS and academic researchers? These agreements have produced scores of important research studies. Just one example: Harvard economist Raj Chetty and colleagues have written a series of groundbreaking papers on economic mobility, including the effects of income on health, based on IRS administrative data.\nReducing Efficiency\nOver time, it may be possible to replace some IRS and Treasury staff with technology such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. But developing those models will itself require the work of staff data scientists, policy experts, and other researchers.\nSlashing research capacity now risks making the federal tax system less transparent to outside analysts, lawmakers, and the public; stifling innovation; and leaving policymakers and tax administrators blind to the effects of what they do on households and businesses. All of which would make government less efficient.",

        "text": "\"I never wanted Moretti to seem like The Weeknd,\" explains Mark Anthony Green, the writer and director of Opus. \"I never wanted him to seem like Elton John. I never wanted it to seem like David Bowie. I’ve been given this amazing opportunity to work with someone as talented as John Malkovich. I believed he was talented enough to create a pop star with really good music that felt original.\"\n\"That seemed crazy to folks at the time because we had very little money to do so, and it's a high degree of difficulty, even if you have the resources. In my mind, I was like, 'Oh, we're wealthy. We have John Malkovich. We have a Marvel budget now. The man said, yes, so we'll figure it out.' If anything, I didn't want him to sound like any of these people that I had interviewed, or any of these people that we listened to or any of these idols.\"\nOpus, which lands in theaters on Friday, March 14, 2025, stars The Bear's Ayo Edebiri as a journalist called Ariel who is invited to the remote compound of a legendary but reclusive pop star, Alfred Moretti, played by John Malkovich. In a maelstrom of sycophants and hard-partying journalists, she finds herself at the heart of the diva’s diabolical plan. The film's ensemble cast includes Yellowjackets' Juliette Lewis, The White Lotus' Murray Bartlett, and Novocaine's Amber Midthunder.\nHow Real Life Industry Experiences Were Channeled Into 'Opus’\nGreen, a former journalist, used the major names he had interviewed over the years as \"the North Stars\" to explain what he shouldn’t do with the movie, saying it's something he and Malkovich discussed a lot.\n\"Moretti was quite a set character,\" the actor recalls. \"The writing could leave a lot of freedom, but still, Moretti did what he did and said what he said. That showed a number of sides of a person, some interesting and appealing, maybe on some level, and others obviously not so appealing, although maybe hopefully interesting. I don't have a lot of experience in that world. I knew three people only vaguely, but having spent a few evenings with people who were iconic stars, I was struck by the fact that they never once referred to themselves.\"\n\"They never said anything about anything they'd ever accomplished; they were extremely curious, including intellectually curious, and all three were very kind. You never know what you'll find in this world, which was my personal experience. In the writing, Moretti was already fully realized on the page, and then you figure out what touches you can bring to it or what things you need to clarify, if for no other reason than to clarify yourselves for yourself so you can portray it.\"\nWhen it came to casting Moretti, Green’s first choice was Malkovich, known for In the Line of Fire, Con Air, and the upcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps. He had no Plan B for his feature directorial debut.\n\"Much to the chagrin of every woman that has ever loved me, my parents, and every basketball coach I have ever had, I’m not a huge fan of Plan Bs, for better or worse. I don’t know if I've ever actively worked on a Plan B. It'll bite you in an ass, I guess, but Plan A is so much fun,\" he muses. \"Once you write something, even a green-lit script, to me, your job is so not done. I'd written a script, people responded to it, and we were ready to make that movie, but I knew that spending time with John, he was going to have ideas, things would come up, and I worked on the script almost every day. I was writing during production.\"\n\"There was a line I wanted to work in the final scene that John wrote where he quotes Dr. Dre, and I was forcing it at one point because I loved the line so much. It was John's idea; I thought it was so funny, charming, and weird. Filmmaking is the best job in the world because you get to be such a big dreamer, and then you collaborate with all these really talented people, and there's real work in that collaboration. If you approach a film with the script feeling like rigid text, I assume that you have a limited film or a limited story. I've only done it once, so I may be wrong, but that's how I feel.\"\nJohn Malkovich Embraced 'Opus's Musical Odyssey\nOne of Opus' standout moments is when Malkovich's Moretti performs new material for his guests, dancing around and on them as they sit in comfy chairs and are blasted with the music. It's sexy and intoxicating, and the actor loved every second of it.\n\"We didn't really do choreography for that because I don't think Mark Anthony wanted that,\" he explains. \"I have done that before, but that was generally done more in period pieces and on the stage. I'd never done anything in the kind of pop world or that movement. You can go a million ways with that. There's a hyper-choreographed version, but we didn't choose to do that, so this was more free-form, interpretive, and fun. I used to love to dance and go dancing seven knee surgeries ago, but I never did it in a piece or anything. Something I haven't done before is always fun to me, and something you might not be able to do is always super interesting. It's not always fun, but it's one of the great joys of this occupation that sometimes you're presented with things where you kind of say, 'Can I do this? I don't know. Would I cast me to do this? No, definitely not.' I'm supposed to do a thing this summer where I play both Joseph Goebbels and Leni Riefenstahl in a piece. We did the reading. No one threw vegetables at us, so that landed. Anyway, if I get the right help and we can figure out the correct notion of it, down to its physicality and structure, we can make it work.\"\nPlaying Moretti also required Malkovich, a two-time Oscar nominee, to sing. It's worth noting that the film features original music written by the legendary Nile Rodgers, coincidentally one of the film's executive producers.\nWith Opus being an A24 film and their history of being extremely creative with promotions, are we likely to get his impressive vocal work released to support the film?\n\"Absolutely,\" Green enthuses. \"We're going to rerelease one song, Dina, Simone, and we are going to release two others. I think the plan is to do that on Friday, March 14, 2025, which is Opus' domestic release date. That's the plan. I think when you're making a film, it's probably bad form to think about the marketing.\"\n\"We wanted the songs to be undeniable. It felt like the dancing was just more interesting to take an Emperor's new clothes approach where you can't take your eyes off it, but he's not technically hitting notes, and it feels like choreography. That felt fresher and like something we hadn't seen. I love, love, love that scene and what John does in it.\"\nMalkovich concludes, “Mark Anthony and I both kind of talked ruefully that we sort of wish we had more songs, but it's so nearly impossible to get really good songs like that to perform. We're lucky that we got these three for Opus.\"",

        "description": "People don’t step into relationships expecting to lose themselves, but in the effort to maintain peace or prove their devotion, they begin to shrink bit by bit.",

        "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/03/13/why-you-need-to-break-free-from-caging-in-relationships-by-a-psychologist/",
        "text": "Relationships should feel like a source of support, love and mutual growth. However, for many, they become a form of caging—an invisible barrier that slowly forms over time, trapping individuals in a cycle of self-sacrifice and emotional dependency.\nThis isn’t always intentional. People don’t step into relationships expecting to lose themselves, but in the effort to maintain peace or prove their devotion, they begin to shrink bit by bit.\nThe invisible cage isn’t built overnight. It takes shape through unspoken compromises, the suppression of personal needs and the quiet erosion of autonomy. It happens when one partner constantly adjusts their wants and desires to accommodate the other, believing that love requires giving without limits. What starts as devotion can turn into an unconscious surrender of self.\nOver time, what was once a partnership begins to feel like an obligation, a space where only one person’s needs truly thrive.\nHere are three ways this invisible cage can harm you in relationships.\n1. You Lose Yourself In The Relationship\nSelf-abandonment in relationships occurs when you continuously suppress your needs, desires and identity to accommodate your partner. It often manifests as ignoring your true feelings, saying “yes” when you mean “no” and putting your partner’s happiness above your own.\nOver time, this can lead to a loss of self-awareness, leaving you feeling unfulfilled and emotionally drained.\nThis tends to happen because you don’t feel safe enough to voice your boundaries. You may even absorb your partner’s likes, dislikes and opinions as your own—a tendency popularly referred to as “chameleoning.”\nOne reason people lose sight of their needs is the fear of rejection or conflict. So many of us are conditioned since childhood to believe that prioritizing ourselves is selfish, which compels us to ignore our inner voice.\nThe emotional toll of self-abandonment can be severe, leading to resentment, exhaustion and anxiety. When your existence revolves around another person, you risk losing the essence of who you truly are.\n2. You Prioritize Your Partner’s Needs Over Your Own\nResearch published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that individuals are happier in relationships when their needs for autonomy (freedom of choice), competence (feeling capable) and relatedness (feeling valued and connected) are fulfilled.\nWhen people felt their needs were met, they were more motivated to be in the relationship for the right reasons. This helped them resolve conflicts better and maintain stronger relationships.\nBut, if you forget to prioritize your needs in a relationship, your partner may also never know how to meet them. Neglecting your needs is a significant sign of self-abandonment.\nIf you often feel unfulfilled despite being in a relationship, regularly prioritize your partner’s needs over your own or experience emotional burnout, you may be ignoring yourself.\nUnmet needs lead to frustration and resentment. When you constantly give without receiving, frustration accumulates, eventually leading to passive-aggressive behavior or emotional withdrawal.\nIt’s important to identify and prioritize what truly matters to you. This involves taking time to reflect on what makes you happy outside the relationship, setting small personal goals and learning to communicate your needs confidently.\n3. You Fall Into The Trap Of Seeking Approval\nThe need for external validation can be detrimental to self-worth. When you rely too much on your partner’s approval, you start losing confidence in your own decision-making abilities. Over time, this dependency erodes self-esteem, making you feel powerless without their validation.\nSeeking approval also affects your boundaries. Instead of making choices that align with your values, you may compromise too much just to maintain peace.\nTo an extent, compromising is essential in a relationship, but when it turns into self-sacrifice, it becomes harmful. A healthy compromise involves mutual effort, while harmful tolerance means consistently sacrificing your well-being to avoid conflict.\nMany excuse bad behavior out of fear of loneliness or confrontation, but allowing mistreatment only reinforces unhealthy dynamics. This is why it’s important to set and uphold boundaries without feeling guilty.\nIf you tend to be a people-pleaser, you might find it challenging to establish boundaries due to a fear of backlash—whether real or perceived. Instead of enforcing everything at once, you can gradually communicate what bothers you and introduce boundaries over time, allowing the other person to adjust while still standing firm in your needs.\nHow To Reclaim Your Agency\nReclaiming your agency starts with building confidence in your own decisions. This can be done by making small choices without seeking approval, trusting your intuition and cultivating independent interests and hobbies. The more you trust yourself, the less dependent you’ll be on external validation.\nMany people fear conflict, but expressing your needs clearly and directly is not aggression—it’s self-respect. Learning to stand your ground, calmly and confidently, can help establish healthier relationship dynamics.\nStop worrying about what others might think or say, and start focusing on how you truly feel. How would you feel if years went by without you valuing your worth or prioritizing your needs?\nNo one enjoys feeling trapped in a cage. No one likes to feel powerless. But if you don’t advocate for yourself, you cannot expect others to do it for you. When you honor your worth, you create space for the kind of love, respect and joy you truly deserve.\nDoes your relationship nurture you or confine you? This science-backed test can give you the clarity you need: Relationship Satisfaction Scale",

        "text": "A reliable electric lawn mower offers a quieter and more efficient way to cut your grass. While gas models have been the standard for decades, today’s best electric lawn mowers are just as capable for most homeowners. Our top pickoverall , the EGO Power+ 21-Inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower, runs for up to an hour on a single charge and delivers even stronger cutting power than some gas mowers. It’s also lightweight, easy to use and comes highly recommended by the lawn and landscaping professionals we consulted.\n“Electric mower technology is advancing very fast each year,” says Ward Dilmore, Founder and Head Landscape Designer at Petrus Landscaping, adding that today’s best models are almost as powerful as gas-powered ones. What’s more, he adds, \"they are far easier to use than gas mowers, as they require virtually no maintenance, and are often lighter and more maneuverable.\" If you’re thinking of making the switch but don’t know where to start, first think about your yard. A more compact model like the Greenworks 60V 19-Inch Cordless Battery Push Lawn Mower is a great option for those with limited storage or a smaller outdoor space. And for anyone who’d rather skip mowing altogether, a robotic electric mower like the Mammotion Luba 2 AWD can keep the lawn trimmed without any effort on your part. To help you find the right fit, we’ve rounded up the best electric lawn mowers for different yard sizes and mowing needs.\nEgo Power+ 21-Inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower\nCutting width: 21 inches | Power source: Battery | Runtime: Up to 60 minutes | Self-propelled: Yes | Weight: 55 pounds\nWhat you’ll love\nCutting power rivals gas mowers\nRuns up to 60 minutes per charge\nSelf-propelled with adjustable speeds\nFolds for compact, vertical storage\nKeep in mind\nSelf-propelled function has a learning curve\nMay not be suitable for very large yards\nThe EGO Power+ 21-Inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower is an easy pick for homeowners who want a powerful and hassle-free way to keep their yard in shape. Unlike older battery-powered mowers, which used to struggle with runtime or cutting power, this one delivers performance that rivals gas without the maintenance. It runs for up to an hour on a single charge and the self-propelled drive system takes the effort out of mowing, especially when you’re going over hills or uneven ground.\nOne of its best features is its vertical storage design, which makes it much easier to tuck away in a garage or shed compared to bulkier gas models. It also comes with three interchangeable blades, so you can switch between mulching, bagging or maximizing battery life depending on what your lawn needs. The adjustable speed control means you can mow at a comfortable pace, and the push-button start eliminates the frustration of yanking on a pull cord.\nWhile some users say the self-propelled system can take a little getting used to, it makes mowing less tiring, especially if you’re covering a larger area. The grass collection bag can also be a bit tricky to attach, but the strong battery life and cutting power make up for these minor drawbacks.\nBest Value Electric Lawn Mower\nA Budget-Friendly Mower With Impressive Performance\nAmerican Lawn Mower Company 120V 14-Inch Corded Electric Lawn Mower\nCutting width: 14 inches | Power type: Corded electric | Runtime: Unlimited (requires extension cord) | Self-propelled: No | Weight: 20 pounds\nWhat you’ll love:\nOne of the most affordable electric mowers available\nStrong motor for its price point\nNo expensive batteries or gas required\nFoldable handle for easy storage\nKeep in mind:\nNarrower cutting width means more passes\nRequires an outdoor-rated extension cord\nIf you want a reliable electric mower without the high price tag, this model offers impressive performance at a fraction of the cost of many competitors. The American Lawn Mower 120V 14-Inch Corded Electric Lawn Mower runs on a plug-in power source, so you never have to worry about battery life or gas refills. Its motor delivers steady power, making it a good fit for keeping up with routine lawn care.\nIt also gives you more options than you’d expect at this price. You can adjust the cutting height for your lawn’s length in five different ways and choose between mulching or bagging your clippings. The narrower cutting width means it might take a little longer to mow a larger space, but the handle folds down for easy storage when you’re done.\nBest Electric Riding Lawn Mower\nA Low-Maintenance Riding Mower For Bigger Yards\nEGO Power+ TR4204 Riding Mower\nCutting width: 42 inches | Power type: Battery-powered | Runtime: Up to 1.5 acres per charge | Self-propelled: Yes | Weight: 639 pounds\nWhat you’ll love:\n42-inch cutting deck for wide coverage\nCruise control for steady speed control\nTow hitch for hauling small loads\nAdjustable high-back seat\nKeep in mind:\nRequires space for storage\nRuns quieter than gas but still makes noise\nThe EGO Power+ TR4204 is an electric riding mower designed for homeowners who want the size and power of a gas model without the maintenance. It runs on rechargeable batteries instead of fuel, delivering enough strength to handle a large yard (up to 1.5 acres) without fumes, oil changes or loud engine noise.\nThe 42-inch cutting deck covers a lot of ground quickly, and you can adjust the blade height to match your lawn’s needs. It also includes cruise control, an LCD display and LED headlights, plus a tow hitch for hauling small loads like yard waste or supplies.\nIf you’re used to gas mowers, switching to electric might take some adjusting—it needs to recharge after mowing, and gas models are still stronger overall. But for anyone who wants a quieter and lower-maintenance alternative, this is one of the best riding lawn mowers available.\nBest Electric Lawn Mower For Small Yards\nA Powerful Yet Manageable Mower For Smaller Spaces\nGreenworks 60V 21-Inch Self-Propelled Lawn Mower\nCutting width: 21 inches | Power type: Battery-powered (60V) | Runtime: Up to 60 minutes per charge | Self-propelled: Yes | Weight: 65 pounds\nWhat you’ll love:\nSelf-propelled function makes mowing easier\nRuns up to an hour per charge\nHandle folds for vertical storage\nMulching, bagging, and side discharge options\nKeep in mind:\nBattery recharges in 80 minutes\nLarger cutting width than some other small-yard models\nIf you have a smaller yard, consider the Greenworks 60V 21-Inch Self-Propelled Lawn Mower, which runs on a rechargeable battery. With this model, you get 60 minutes of runtime without having to deal with gas, oil or cords.\nThe self-propelled feature takes a lot of the work out of mowing, especially if your yard has slight slopes or uneven patches. This model has a 21-inch deck, which is slightly larger than some other small-yard options, but that also means you can cover more ground in less time. Plus, it has four cutting modes: mulching, bagging, side discharge and turbo leaf pickup. For storage, the handle folds down, so you can store it vertically to save space in a garage or shed.\nBest Corded Electric Lawn Mower\nA Powerful Corded Option With A Wide Cutting Deck\nCraftsman 20-Inch 3-In-1 Corded Lawn Mower\nCutting width: 20 inches | Power source: Corded electric | Runtime: Unlimited (requires extension cord) | Self-propelled: No | Weight: 45 pounds\nWhat you’ll love:\nCuts through thick grass with ease\nWide deck reduces mowing time\nBuilt-in handle for easy carrying\nKeep in mind:\nRequires an outdoor-rated extension cord\nCord limits movement compared to battery models\nFor those who prefer the reliability of a corded mower, the Craftsman 20-Inch 3-in-1 Corded Lawn Mower gives you strong cutting power without the hassle of refilling gas or changing batteries. “Corded mowers really only work for small yards since the cord does keep you anchored, but they are often the quietest type of mower and they can still perform really well,\" says Steve Corcoran, CEO of Lawn Love.\nWith a wide 20-inch deck, this model covers more ground in fewer passes, helping you finish the job faster. Plus, the powerful blade slices cleanly through thick or overgrown grass, so you don’t have to go over the same spot twice. A single-lever height adjustment lets you switch between five cutting heights from 1.5 to 4 inches, and three cutting modes—mulching, bagging and side discharge—offer flexibility in how you handle clippings. The built-in transport handle makes it easy to lift and store when you’re finished.\nBest Robot Electric Lawn Mower\nA High-Tech Way To Skip Mowing Altogether\nMammotion Luba 2 AWD\nCutting width: 15.7 inches | Power type: Battery-powered | Runtime: 190 minutes | Max lawn size: 1.25 acres | Weight: Varies by model\nWhat you’ll love:\nMows automatically\nCovers up to 1.25 acres with app-controlled zones\nAI-powered navigation avoids obstacles and adjusts routes\nKeep in mind:\nCosts as much as some riding mowers\nRobotic mower technology is still evolving\nThe Mammotion Luba 2 AWD works like one of the best robot vacuums, except it's for your yard. Once set up, this fully autonomous mower maps out your lawn, avoids obstacles and trims the grass without the need for much interference. It’s designed for larger lawns (up to 1.25 acres) and can even handle steep slopes with its all-wheel-drive system. Unlike older models that require physical boundary wires, this one uses AI-powered navigation and an app-controlled multi-zone system, so you can customize where and when it mows. You can also adjust the cutting height between 1 and 4 inches to match your lawn’s needs.\nAt around the same price as a riding mower, this is a serious investment—but it’s also a huge time-saver. If you’d rather spend weekends doing something other than mowing, this is one of the most advanced robotic options available.\nAt Forbes Vetted, we’ve covered everything from the best pool vacuums to the best patio furniture, helping readers find the most useful products for their homes. Our team of home editors has researched, tested and reviewed dozens of outdoor products to bring you expert-backed recommendations you can trust.\nThis article was written by home and kitchen editor Kelly O’Sullivan, who has years of experience covering home products and appliances. It was overseen by senior home and kitchen editor Amanda Arnold.\nOur picks for the best electric lawn mowers are backed by expert insights to ensure we’re recommending models that offer real performance and value. We consulted with Ward Dilmore, founder of Petrus Landscaping; Steve Corcoran, CEO of Lawn Love; and Matt Davies, managing director at Garden Lawncare Guy.\nWe regularly update our guides to keep our top picks current and ensure we’re recommending only the best options for each category.\nHow We Chose The Best Electric Lawn Mowers\nTo find the best electric lawn mowers, we researched top-rated models, analyzed key features and consulted lawn care experts to determine which options work best for different yard sizes and mowing needs.\nWe focused on electric mowers from reputable brands like EGO, Greenworks and Ryobi, selecting models known for reliability, cutting power and ease of use.\nWe prioritized mowers with practical features that improve the mowing experience, like long battery life, self-propelled functionality for easier handling and multiple cutting modes.\nWe consulted three lawn care experts to understand how electric mowers compare to gas models and what factors matter most when choosing the right one.\nWe considered real-world feedback from electric mower owners, prioritizing models with consistently high customer ratings and reviews that demonstrate long-term performance and durability.\nWhat To Look For In An Electric Lawn Mower\nThe best electric lawn mower for you depends on your yard size, terrain and whether you prefer a corded or battery-powered model. While gas mowers still have their place, electric options have come a long way. “Electric mowers have seen a huge increase in popularity over the past few years, especially battery-powered machines, and it’s no surprise as to why,” says Matt Davies, managing director at Garden Lawncare Guy. “They’re often lighter, easier to maneuver, don’t require storing hazardous fuel and have fewer moving parts—so there’s less maintenance and less to go wrong.” Here’s what to keep in mind when choosing the right model for your lawn.\nType\nElectric mowers fall into two main categories: corded and battery-powered. “Corded electric mowers will have constant power that will not diminish as long as they are plugged in,” says Davies. Just keep in mind that you’ll need an outdoor-rated extension cord long enough to reach your entire mowing area. On the other hand, battery-powered mowers offer more freedom but can limit your ability to continue mowing if the battery runs out. Some models run for just 30 minutes, while others can last up to an hour or more. If you have a larger yard, look for one with multiple battery ports or keep a backup battery on hand.\nFeatures\nMost electric mowers are lighter than gas models and start with the push of a button. Some include self-propelled systems that make mowing easier, especially on slopes or when covering larger areas. Other useful features include adjustable cutting heights, mulching and bagging capabilities and smart functions like app-controlled scheduling or LED headlights for mowing in low light.\nDeck Size\nThe deck size (or cutting width) determines how much grass the mower cuts in one pass. Smaller decks (under 18 inches) work well for tight spaces and small yards, while larger decks (20 inches or more) are better for covering more ground quickly. “The best features for any lawn mower start with getting the right size mower for your lawn,” says Matt. “If your lawn size increases, your deck size will need to increase to reduce your workload.” If your yard has narrow pathways or obstacles, a smaller deck will be easier to maneuver. For those who want to mow faster, a wider deck will save you time.",

        "text": "The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) took a major step toward becoming law after passing the Senate Banking Committee in a bipartisan 18-6 vote. Sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), the bill establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, marking a significant shift in U.S. cryptocurrency policy. The bill’s advancement reflects growing momentum for stablecoin regulation but has also intensified divisions within the financial industry and political establishment.\nBipartisan Push for Clarity in Stablecoin Regulation\nIntroduced on February 4, 2025, the GENIUS Act aims to provide long-overdue regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and investors. Stablecoins, cryptocurrency tokens pegged to the value of a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, are already widely used in both the crypto economy and traditional financial markets. Despite their increasing adoption, stablecoins have operated in a murky regulatory environment, leading to uncertainty for both businesses and consumers.\nSenator Hagerty emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity in his opening remarks at the Senate Banking Committee markup:\nAs the world modernizes its payment systems, the U.S. cannot be left behind,” Hagerty said. “Stablecoins can play a pivotal role in spurring that modernization. Whether it’s improving transaction efficiency, freeing up working capital, or driving U.S. Treasury demand, the benefits of a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins are immense.”\nThe GENIUS Act establishes licensing and regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers at both the federal and state levels. It permits state oversight of stablecoin issuers with a market capitalization under $10 billion, while larger issuers will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\nKey Provisions of the GENIUS Act:\n1. Licensing and Oversight:\n- Stablecoin issuers with a market cap below $10 billion will be regulated at the state level.\n- Issuers exceeding $10 billion will face direct oversight from the Federal Reserve and OCC.\n2. Transparency and Reserve Standards:\n- Issuers must provide monthly liquidity reports.\n- Full transparency on reserve composition is required to maintain trust and stability.\n- Stablecoins must be backed by reserves held in U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets on a 1:1 basis.\n3. Redemption and Consumer Protection:\n- Issuers must meet redemption requests promptly.\n- The Federal Reserve and OCC have the authority to suspend licenses or impose penalties for non-compliance.\n4. AML/KYC Compliance:\n- Issuers must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards to prevent misuse for illicit activities.\nCommittee Composition and Oversight\nThe Senate Banking Committee, formally known as the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is responsible for overseeing federal monetary policy, financial institutions, and international economic policy. Its jurisdiction includes banks, deposit insurance, the Federal Reserve, housing, and export controls.\nThe current composition of the committee includes 13 Republicans and 10 Democrats.\nThe bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act reflects rare political consensus on crypto legislation, especially in the current hyper-partisan political climate. Notably, five Democratic senators—Rochester (D-Del.), Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Kim (D-N.J.), Gallego (D-Ariz.), and Warner (D-Va.) —joined all 13 Republicans in supporting the bill. This year, the committee also plans to address market frameworks for digital assets.\nIndustry Backing and Political Alignments\nThe bill’s bipartisan nature reflects broad support among industry participants and policymakers. Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer, Dante Disparte, praised the bill’s passage as \"historic and bipartisan progress on creating a principled, America-first framework for regulating payment stablecoins,” and explaining further that “the GENIUS Act provides a pathway for the U.S. to lead rather than be led.” Circle is the issuer of the USDC stablecoin.\nConsumer Advocate Pushback and Conflict of Interest Concerns\nDespite industry enthusiasm, consumer protection groups have raised alarms about the GENIUS Act’s potential to legitimize risky crypto schemes. Public Citizen, a prominent consumer advocacy group, warned that the bill could destabilize financial markets and erode consumer protections.\nIn a letter to the committee, Bartlett Naylor, Public Citizen’s financial policy advocate, cautioned:\nIf the GENIUS Act becomes law, price manipulations, coin failures, and use of cryptocurrencies in illicit finance will increase. The committee should reject this ill-conceived, incomplete, and threatening legislation.\nNaylor warned that the bill’s failure to extend the Bank Holding Company Act restrictions to stablecoin issuers would open the door for big tech firms like Amazon, Walmart, and Meta to enter the banking sector without sufficient safeguards:\n“The GENIUS Act invites major commercial firms such as Amazon, Walmart, Twitter/X, and/or Facebook/Meta to enter the banking sector because it lacks provisions under the Bank Holding Company Act that would prohibit non-financial firms from entering the banking business.”\nAdding to the controversy, reports have surfaced that the Trump family has been in talks to purchase a stake in Binance U.S., the world’s largest crypto exchange, despite its history of legal troubles. Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), recently served a four-month prison sentence for facilitating money laundering. Although Zhao denied the reports, the potential Trump-Binance deal has raised significant ethical concerns.\nFurther complicating matters, Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick (CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald), has deep ties to Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer. Lutnick’s firm is Tether’s primary banker and holds billions in U.S. Treasury securities as reserves for Tether. While his deep knowledge and experience in the crypto industry is unquestioned, his equally deep ties to Tether raise real concerns about potential or actual conflicts of interest, especially given Tether’s essential role in decentralized finance ecosystem.\nNonetheless, stablecoin legislation would likely force Tether to comply with transparent reserve requirements in order to compete in the United States with compliant-focused stablecoins like Circle’s USDC.\nBicameral Alignment?\nIn the House of Representatives, competing stablecoin bills reflect divergent regulatory approaches, but Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) has introduced a discussion draft that closely mirrors Hagerty’s GENIUS Act. Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, has championed a framework that establishes a balance between federal and state oversight for stablecoin issuers. Under Hill’s bill, smaller stablecoin issuers with a market capitalization under $10 billion would be regulated at the state level, while larger issuers would fall under the direct supervision of the Federal Reserve and the OCC. This state-federal split reflects a pragmatic approach designed to maintain market flexibility while ensuring sufficient regulatory oversight at the federal level.\nHill’s bill mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain 1:1 reserves in U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets, ensuring that each digital dollar is fully backed and redeemable on demand. By mirroring key elements of the GENIUS Act, Hill’s proposal seeks to create a unified federal framework that provides regulatory clarity for the stablecoin market without stifling innovation. Hill has emphasized that bipartisan cooperation will be essential to crafting effective, “fit-for-purpose” regulation that promotes consumer protection while fostering the growth of the domestic digital asset industry.\nIn contrast to Hill’s market-driven approach, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has introduced a more centralized and enforcement-heavy stablecoin bill. Waters’ proposal would require all stablecoin issuers—regardless of size—to be regulated at the federal level, eliminating the option for state-level oversight. Her bill explicitly prohibits “big tech” firms, such as Meta, Amazon, and X, from issuing stablecoins, citing concerns over corporate concentration and systemic risk. It also tightens regulatory controls on offshore companies to prevent them from evading U.S. financial regulations. Furthermore, the bill introduces strict eligibility requirements for ownership of stablecoin issuers, barring individuals with past convictions for financial crimes, including fraud and money laundering, from owning more than 5% of a stablecoin company.\nWaters has framed her bill as a necessary consumer protection measure designed to prevent the kind of market instability and fraud that plagued the crypto industry in the past. While Hill’s bill emphasizes market innovation and flexibility, Waters’ bill focuses on regulatory rigor and systemic risk management.\nHill’s alignment with the GENIUS Act seems to reflect a strategic effort to harmonize House and Senate proposals, increasing the chances of securing a bipartisan agreement on stablecoin regulation. Both Hill and Hagerty have presented their bills as essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in the digital asset space and countering the growing influence of China’s digital yuan and the European Union's comprehensive cryptocurrency framework. The alignment between Hill’s and Hagerty’s approaches signals alignment with Trump’s promise to position the United States as the global leader in stablecoin innovation and regulation.\nPath Forward and Political Stakes\nThe GENIUS Act’s passage in the Senate Banking Committee marks a pivotal moment in U.S. crypto policy, but its path to becoming law uncertain. The bill will require at least 60 votes to advance in the Senate, making bipartisan cooperation essential.",

        "text": "A viral threat is now sweeping across America, “from state to state,” as malicious SMS texts demand money for unpaid bills. The FBI has warned iPhone and Android users to delete all such texts received. Now a new and even more malicious SMS threat has prompted the police to warn smartphone users to delete and report messages.\nThe Hampden County Sheriff’s Office in Massachusetts took to Facebook to out the latest scam, which threatens recipients that the police has attempted to serve them “a notice of action pertaining to an investigation against you,” and failure to respond will result in further legal action being initiated.\nThe police warn recipients of these “alarming messages” that “law enforcement will never call, text, or email to demand money, resolve a warrant, or conduct official business. If you receive a message like this, do not engage — delete it and report it.”\nThis is not an isolated incident, and there have been regular reports of scammers impersonating state and local law enforcement, and even federal agencies, demanding payment to avoid arrest and prosecution. All such messages are scams.\nIn this latest Massachusetts attack, the links included in the messages lead to websites that are designed to install malware on devices. While anyone receiving such a text should dismiss it immediately, the scammers make detection more difficult by spoofing agency numbers to present a legitimate caller ID, “likely using internet-based services.”\nThe police urge citizens to “please share this warning with your family and friends, especially those who may be more vulnerable to scams.”\nWhile law enforcement scams are becoming more common, the real threat is unpaid tolls and undelivered packages. The news this week that 10,000 new web domains have been registered to fuel such scams just highlights the scale this has now reached.\n“Stay safe!” says Hampden County’s Sheriff’s Office.",

        "text": "While the general term Mediterranean has been used for years to describe the abundant beaches, warm weather and vegetable-forward foods found in countries like Italy, Greece and France, the Eastern side of this sea is finally getting some attention. I first saw the trend with restaurants like Neni in Amsterdam and finally it is leaping over borders to the U.S. dining scene.\nI recently had a chance to visit Evelyn’s at the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale and talked to chef executive chef Brandon Salomon about the culinary lineup. All responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.\nLiza B. Zimmerman: Why offer Eastern Mediterranean food instead of standard Mediterranean?\nBrandon Salomon (B.S.): Eastern Mediterranean cuisine offers a unique and diverse flavor profile that sets it apart from standard Mediterranean fare, which is often more Italian- or Greek-focused. The combination of bold spices, fresh herbs, legumes and olive oil creates a vibrant and dynamic dining experience. Additionally, Eastern Mediterranean cuisine is deeply rooted in hospitality and communal dining, making it an inviting and approachable option for guests looking for something familiar yet exciting.\nL.B.Z.: How does serving this food change your wine pairing options? Or potentially open up pairings to traditionally Eastern Mediterranean spirits?\nB.S.: The bold flavors, spice-driven dishes and olive oil-rich preparations of Eastern Mediterranean cuisine require wines with bright acidity, minerality and fruit-forward flavors. This opens up pairings to unique selections from regions such as Lebanon, Turkey, Greece and Israel, where winemaking traditions complement the depth of these flavors. Additionally, Eastern Mediterranean spirits like arak, raki and ouzo (anise-based liquors) pair beautifully with meze-style dishes, enhancing the overall dining experience with their herbal and refreshing qualities.\nL.B.Z.: I saw some Lebanese selections and we ordered a Palestinian wine. Why choose these wines for the list and how do they pair better with the food?\nB.S.: Lebanese and Palestinian wines are rooted in ancient winemaking traditions, producing varietals that naturally align with Eastern Mediterranean flavors. The structured reds, aromatic whites and crisp rosés from these regions offer bright acidity and earthy undertones that complement the richness of dishes like lamb kofta, hummus, or grilled seafood. These wines tend to have balanced fruit and spice notes, which enhance—rather than overpower—the bold seasoning of the cuisine.\nL.B.Z.: How did you find and choose these wines?\nB.S.: The selection process was guided by a desire to showcase wines that are not only representative of the region but also pair exceptionally well with the menu. We worked closely with importers who specialize in Eastern Mediterranean wines and sought out winemakers dedicated to preserving the authenticity of their terroir. Tasting and understanding the balance between acidity, tannins and fruit allowed us to curate a list that enhances the dining experience while introducing guests to lesser-known wines.\nL.B.Z.: Can food and wine offer a bit of soft diplomacy in this case? In terms of how it gets guests thinking about culture and traditions in some areas that have been suffering?\nB.S.: Absolutely. Food and wine have long been cultural ambassadors, providing an opportunity for storytelling, education and connection. By showcasing wines from regions like Lebanon and Palestine—and serving dishes inspired by the Levant—we create a space where guests can engage with the rich culinary history of these areas. This not only fosters appreciation for the cuisine but also sparks curiosity about the traditions, struggles and resilience of the people behind it. It’s a subtle, yet impactful, way to bridge cultural gaps through the universal language of food and hospitality.",

        "text": "Topline\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) may have violated House ethics rules on Wednesday by calling on the Department of Justice and FBI to investigate protests against Tesla–a company in which she has a financial interest, buying stock in it as recently as last week.\nKey Facts\nGreene owned less than $1,000 in Tesla stock at the end of 2023, but beginning in September 2024–amid Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s increasingly vocal support for Donald Trump–she went on a buying spree, making nine purchases totaling between $9,000 and $135,000, according to disclosures she filed with the House Clerk’s Office.\nAfter Trump won the presidency and the GOP clinched control of Congress, Greene announced she would chair a new House Oversight subcommittee supervising Musk’s work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nFive of Greene’s Tesla stock purchases came after that appointment, the most recent of which was $1,000 to $15,000 worth of shares on March 7.\nProtests targeting Tesla—ranging from peaceful demonstrations to arson and gunfire—have appeared across the country, seemingly fueled by concerns over Musk’s deep cuts to federal government staff and spending.\nOn Wednesday, Greene–in her capacity as chair of the DOGE subcommittee–wrote to the Justice Department and the FBI, calling on the agencies “to prioritize a thorough investigation” into what she called “the recent wave of organized attacks targeting Elon Musk and Tesla car dealerships, charging stations, and vehicles across the country.”\nAfter this article was published, Nick Dyer, a spokesperson for Greene, responded to Forbes’ earlier inquiry: “It’s about domestic terrorist attacks, Zach. You are nothing more than a Democrat troll. Enough out of you.”\nCrucial Quote\nAccording to the House’s code of conduct, “A Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House may not receive compensation and may not permit compensation to accrue to the beneficial interest of such individual from any source, the receipt of which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from the position of such individual in Congress.”\nChief Critic\n“The letter could raise a serious ethics issue for Representative Greene,” Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in campaign finance, told Forbes. “House ethics rules prohibit a member from taking any official action that would benefit her own financial interest.” Kappel cited a 2012 House ethics investigation into Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) that found she violated the law by “improperly using her official position for her beneficial interest” by helping her husband’s medical practice obtain payments from government agencies that he believed he was owed.\nBig Number\nGreene’s stake in Tesla is likely valued between $7,400 and $116,000, as of Wednesday’s close, based on congressional disclosure rules that require lawmakers to report holdings only in broad ranges. Her investments, however, have likely lost value—Tesla closed at $248.09 on Wednesday, below the stock’s lowest price on six of the nine days she bought shares.\nCrucial Quote\n“🚨Attacks on Tesla must be investigated as domestic terrorism! 🚨,” Greene wrote Wednesday on X (formerly Twitter) in a post sharing her letter. “Today, my @DOGECommittee colleagues and I sent a letter to @AGPamBondi and @FBIDirectorKash asking for an investigation into the wave of organized attacks targeting @elonmusk, @Tesla, and the @DOGE effort. Who is behind it? Who is funding it? Is there a link with Democrat-leaning NGOs? We look forward to exposing these terrorists and bringing them to justice!”\nWhat To Watch For\nIn January, Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) and Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) filed the No Corruption in Government Act, which would ban House members and their spouses from holding, purchasing or selling stocks, bonds, options and other securities while in office. The bill is in committee.\nSurprising Fact\nIn June 2024, Greene introduced an amendment to the defense budget seeking to ban federal funds from being used on electrical vehicles or electrical vehicle infrastructure.\nTangent\nBefore joining Congress in 2021, Greene held between $15,000 and $50,000 in Tesla stock. By the end of 2022, the value of her holdings had dwindled to less than $1,000—likely due to her divorce settlement that year.\nForbes Valuation\nDespite Tesla’s plummeting stock price, Elon Musk remains far and away the wealthiest person in the world, worth an estimated $327 billion.\nFurther Viewing\nFurther Reading\nTrump SPAC Investor Rep.

        "description": "The best self-emptying robot vacuums offer a truly hands-off cleaning experience. Here are our top picks from iRobot, Eufy, Shark and more.",
        "authors": "Christine Colby",
        "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-self-emptying-robot-vacuum/",
        "text": "The main appeal of robot vacuums is that the device does the cleaning for you, freeing you up for other activities or relaxation. And for those who really want to enjoy an effortless cleaning experience, consider a self-emptying model. You barely even have to touch these devices, as they return to their docks and deposit their debris into bins that only need occasional emptying. Out of the very best self-emptying robot vacuums, our top pick overall is the iRobot Roomba s9+, as it can hold a charge for 120 minutes, is conveniently shaped to reach corners and it has extra strong suction power.\nWhile self-emptying models are great for busy professionals and pet owners, they’re especially “ideal for allergy sufferers, since self-emptying models often use sealed bags to trap dust,\" says Ahmed Mezil, CEO of cleaning company Hellamaid. They also make sense for “people with larger homes, where a standard bin fills up too quickly,” he adds. Many robot vacuums cost more than a standard vacuum does, but their autonomous nature means you get your time back. Even so, we’ve included a more affordable (but still efficient) option, the Eufy X8 Pro, if you don’t want to spend too much. We also have a top-rated recommendation for pet hair, a vacuum-mop combo and more.\nBase dimensions: 11.49 x 14.93 x 19.02 inches | Robot dimensions: 12.25 x 3.5 inches | Dustbin capacity: 60 days | Max runtime: 75 minutes | Warranty: 3 years | Features: PerfectEdge Technology, dirt detection, voice control\nWhat you’ll love:\nD-shape to get into corners\nCleans up to 120 minutes on one charge\nStrong suction power\nKeep in mind:\nNoisier than some other robot vacs\nIsn’t specifically designed to avoid pet waste\nWhile robot vacuums traditionally have a round shape, the iRobot Roomba s9+ has a D-shape, which helps it gets into corners to pick up dirt circular vacuums can miss. This model has a souped-up engine with impressive power to inhale debris without scattering it all over the place. The large, wide rubber brushroll is located at the front of the device, which helps it really shine at pulling dirt and debris from carpets and perform well at picking up even longer hair strands.\nThe advanced camera-based smart floor-mapping system can learn and remember about specific furniture placement, and you can instruct it to exclude specific areas. This model has multilevel mapping (with the capacity to store up to ten maps), so it’s a great choice for homes with more than one floor.\nThe bin capacity should last you two months without emptying. That, along with the up to 120 minutes runtime on one charge, makes the s9+ a hands-off and effortless choice. The app is easy to navigate, and works with Alexa and other voice assistants so you can direct it to a specific mess that needs cleaned promptly. The s9+ also learns your needs and habits and can suggest additional seasonal cleanings to fight allergens like pollen and shedded pet hair. Note that this model does not feature Roomba’s P.O.O.P. Promise, meaning it’s not designed to specially avoid pet messes. Pet owners with animals prone to accidents may want to invest in a different model (like the popular j7+ model), although this pick is still our favorite for anyone else.\nBest Self-Emptying Robot Vacuum For Pet Hair\nAll The Features Pet Parents Want\niRobot Roomba j7+\nBase dimensions: 15.7 x 11.9 x 13.3 inches | Robot dimensions: 13.3 x 3.4 inches | Dustbin capacity: 60 days | Max runtime: 90 minutes | Warranty: 3 years | Features: Dirt detection, obstacle avoidance, voice control\nWhat you’ll love:\nAdept at avoiding pet waste\nCompatible with Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant\nKeep in mind:\nMay struggle with debris trapped between wood floor planks\nAlso from iRobot, the Roomba j7+ has a lot in common with our top overall pick—but it’s more suited for people with pets. While it retains the more common circular shape, it does feature an edge-sweeping brush to help get debris out of corners and up against baseboards. The dual rubber brushrolls help suction up pet hair and debris from wood floors, linoleum and carpets—whatever you’ve got. Users report that even with a bin full of pet hair, after docking the self-emptying features works smoothly with no clogs.\nHellamaid’s Mezil praises the Roomba j7+ as the best pick for pet owners for its, “great pet hair pickup and smart obstacle avoidance.” The app offers smart mapping of your home and also to specify “Clean Zones” and “Keep Out Zones.” As the robot scoots along, it takes photos of obstacles it encounters and gives you the opportunity to identify them to train the vac—so you can let it know whether it found pet waste, a cat toy, an ear bud or something it should attempt to vacuum up. You can also order replacement bags for the dustbin directly through the app. iRobot is so sure that this vacuum can successfully navigate around pet waste that it offers the P.O.O.P. (Pet Owner Official Promise): The company will provide you with a replacement vacuum if yours runs into dog poop. Note that some reviewers do report encounters with the j7+ and pet waste, so it’s possible you might have to take them up on their offer.\nBest Value Self-Emptying Robot Vacuum\nA Reliable Option For A Budget\nEufy X8 Pro Robot Vacuum Self-Empty Station\nBase dimensions: 15.1 x 7.7 x 6.1 inches | Robot dimensions: 13.9 x 13.8 inches | Dustbin capacity: 60 days | Max runtime: 180 minutes | Warranty: 1 year | Features: Detangling roller brush, laser navigation, mop, child lock\nWhat you’ll love:\nLow price compared to comparable models\nAccurate iPath laser navigation\nBi-directional detangling roller brush\nKeep in mind:\nNot the newest model\nThis isn’t the newest robot vacuum from Eufy, but it’s a solid option with great features that’s been well reviewed. And if you want a self-emptying robot vacuum without paying closer to $1,000 for it, the X8 Pro is a great choice. Eufy claims that the powerful twin-turbine suction of the X8 Pro in conjunction with their roller brush technology mean the robot not only suctions up any hair from your floors, but that hair also doesn’t get tangled up in the works.\nThe Eufy Clean app works in conjunction with the customizable AI mapping feature to program where you want to the vacuum to go and what its boundaries are. The iPath laser navigation scans for obstacles to avoid—like your sleeping cat.\nAccording to Eufy, the 2.5 liter anti-bacterial bag in the station stores your dust and debris for up to 60 days without emptying in a three-person household with no pets, 45 days with one pet and 30 days with two pets.\nBest Self-Emptying Robot Vacuum For Carpet\nDetects Dirt Deep In Carpet Fibers\nShark Detect Pro Self-Empty Robot Vacuum\nDimensions: 20.1 x 13.4 x 13.6 inches | Dustbin capacity: 60 days | Max runtime: 90 minutes | Warranty: 1 year | Features: HEPA filter, NeverStuck Technology\nWhat you’ll love:\nHas a HEPA filter\nCompatible with Amazon Echo, Alexa, Google Assistant\nLIDAR laser mapping\nKeep in mind:\nSome reviewers mention issues using it with 5G\nAir-blasting feature could scatter dust\nShark Detect Pro has features that make it ideal for a home with multiple flooring surfaces or carpets or rugs of different piles. The unit’s NeverStuck Technology can detect when a higher level is in front of it. Then, like a Transformer, it sprouts gear-like legs on each side to actually lift it up over obstacles and uneven flooring and lower it down again. This, combined with the ability to adjust the brushroll when it detects carpet, makes it ideal for shoppers looking for a self-emptying robot vacuum that can handle cleaning rugs.\nThis vacuum has multiple sensors including its EdgeDetect, which produces a blast of air around edges and corners to dislodge debris so it can suction it up. Some users have reported that the air gusts can actually scatter dirt around, though, so the device may have to go back over the area.\nBest Self-Emptying Vacuum And Mop Combo\nVibrating Mop Pad Lifts Over Carpets\nRoborock S8 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum And Mop\nBase dimensions: 16.8 x 20.2 x 17.7 inches | Robot dimensions: 13.8 x 13.9 x 3.8 inches | Dustbin capacity: 7 weeks | Max runtime: 180 minutes | Warranty: 1 year | Features: High-power suction, fast charging, multiple cleaning settings\nWhat you’ll love:\nEmpties, washes, dries and refills itself\nDual rubber brushrolls avoid tangling hair\nPreciSense LIDAR navigation\nKeep in mind:\nDoesn’t work with 5G\nThe Roborock S8 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop has four cleaning settings for ultimate flexibility: vacuum only, mop only, vacuum then mop, and vacuum and mop simultaneously.\nThe mop pad vibrates to help it pick up muck, which makes this device better at scraping off dried stains than some other models. Even when the mop feature is engaged, the S8 Pro Ultra can sense a rug or carpet so it can lift the wet pad up.\nInfrared imaging and 3D obstacle avoidance help the unit avoid hazards in both light and dark rooms. The convenient app lets you schedule cleaning cycles and map a home up to four floors. Also, you can set the vacuum to clean along the floor direction to minimize scraping along seams and divisions on your flooring. All of the self-directed features mean this model is almost effortless to use, aside from periodically refilling the clean water tank, emptying the dirty tank from the dock and, approximately every seven weeks, changing the dustbin bag. The self-washing and self-drying features also help deter mold and odors accumulating in the tanks.\nWe consulted with Ahmed Mezil, CEO of cleaning company Hellamaid, and Marla Mock, presidentofMolly Maid, aNeighborly company. Mezil’s and Mock’s expertise informed our recommendations.\nWe regularly review our content to ensure we continue to stand by our picks (and that our favorite models remain in stock). This story was published in March 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Self-Emptying Robot Vacuums\nTo narrow down our list to the best self-emptying robot vacuums, we relied on our own expertise with vacuums, conducted extensive research and dove deep into consumer reviews.\nWe analyzed the newest and the top-rated devices from trusted and reliable brands, including iRobot, Eufy and Shark.\nWe evaluated a handful of factors, including each robot vacuum’s suction power, obstacle avoidance technology, dust bin capacity, run time and more.\nWe considered options for various use cases and budgets, selecting a range of products so we’d have a recommendation for everyone.\nWe relied on the expert advice and insights of both Mezil and Mock.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat Is The Best Self-Emptying Robot Vacuum?\nThe best self-emptying robot vacuum for you will depend on your lifestyle, whether your home is mostly smooth floored or carpeted, whether you have pets and a number of other personal factors. While there are many more specialized models, we think the iRobot Roomba s9+ is a solid option that will do the job for most shoppers.\nIs It Worth Getting A Self-Emptying Robot Vacuum?\nIf you have the budget to invest in a self-emptying robot vacuum, we think it’s worth it. Once you’ve set up the app and mapped your cleaning zones, you can let the device do the work while you accomplish other tasks or just relax. “For those with busy schedules, pets or allergies, the convenience and reduced maintenance make it a worthwhile purchase,\" says Mock. “While they may come at a higher price point, the time saved and improved cleanliness often justify the cost. Mock also points out that “this type of vacuum can also be a great option for elderly individuals or those aging in place, as it requires minimal physical effort.” She continues: Once the initial setup and mapping are complete—potentially with assistance—it can be operated with the push of a button, making routine cleaning much easier and more accessible.”\nWhat Are The Negatives Of Robot Vacuums?\nBefore you unleash your new device on your floors, you will have to connect it to your Wi-Fi, set up the app, help it to map your rooms and perform a number of other initial tasks. Some people find them daunting, but once that’s all done, the vacuum will function mainly on its own. There are cases when a vacuum gets “lost” or stuck and may need to be rescued from somewhere in your home, but these are rare. Mock adds that they “do not come with attachments for cleaning furniture, high places and crevices, limiting their versatility.” Most robot vacuums have the capability to avoid obstacles in their paths and many can even specifically identify dog poop. But in the rare chance that your vacuum does encounter pet waste, that would be the most negative aspect.",

        "text": "“I love the poorly educated.”\nRemember that? Candidate Donald Trump, then President Donald Trump, uttered that remark repeatedly during his three presidential campaigns – and he did it in his signature brazen, belligerent style. It got a lot of laughs and cheers at one rally after another, becoming the closest thing to a mantra or tag line he had. And he meant every impactful word of it.\nWe’ve come to learn why.\nWhy does Trump love the “poorly educated”?\nFor the purposes of establishing a baseline and some context, let’s settle on what we mean by poorly – or well – educated. I hold that a well-educated person is one who, ultimately, can and does think critically and independently. Well-educated people – no matter their field of study or career endeavor – verify what they see, challenge what they hear, nurture what they think, and care what they say. This is the product of a rigorous education that begins in the elementary school years, building on itself to the point of being an ongoing, lifelong commitment to self-development. Well-educated people need not be scholars or scientists, historians or poets, executives or diplomats. They need to think critically and think on their own. And they get what we’re saying here. To those who are poorly educated, this paragraph has been utterly meaningless.\nAmong other behaviors, critical and independent thinkers are active citizens in their democracies. They vote responsibly, attend local council meetings and town halls, support public education, read credible newspapers and journals (albeit online these days), and value the “other” person.\nThe “poorly educated” that Mr. Trump so publicly romanced, do not. Mobilize them, and you win elections. They care not that the economy under the previous administration was the strongest since post-World War II decade. Or that the job market was the strongest it’s ever been in history. Or that trade was healthy, construction was booming, the middle class was flourishing, and science was innovating, Donald Trump, on the other hand, said the economy was in the toilet, jobs were going away, the 2020 election was stolen, January 6 was OK, and transgender people had no claim to the same rights as others. Then he made his objects of affection – the “poorly educated” – angry and supercharged and got them to vote that way. Give him credit; he got it done. And he didn’t even hide it. He loves the “poorly educated” – and there are the results. They anointed him. Give him credit.\nHow’s that working out?\nBut wait. Many of those same “poorly educated” are now angry, but at a different target. They’re upset with Trump, they’re upset with Musk, they’re upset with Musk’s four-year old son having the run of the Oval Office like his own day care center, and they’re upset – angry, in fact, that their elected congresspersons won’t even stand in front of them for a town hall. And how do these “poorly educated” people know this? Because they’re now going to those meetings, not to mention other civic activities.\nThe polls tell the story.\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, in a survey of 13 polls taken through March 11, President Trump has a negative rating in nine of them, with a range of -2 to -12. At the same time, in four polls, Mr. Trump has a favorable rating of +1 to +7. Total aggregate spread is -3.1. Results are nearly the same for Vice President Vance.\nAccounting for the rapid shift\nHow did such a large, sweeping shift occur so fast? Even the most effective and efficient political machine can’t do that. The answer is that, by the millions, those “poorly educated” people got themselves educated. Then they attended town halls by the hundreds, stood at protests in all 50 state capitals and countless other sites by the thousands, and they called and wrote to their elected officials by the millions. They organized, they mobilized, and they flexed their new-found muscle. They very quickly became the type of people that Donald Trump – by his own accord – doesn’t like.\nThey became critical, independent thinkers. They left the ranks of the “poorly educated.” And for this upward force of civic awareness, civic involvement, and civic activism – of which Henry David Thoreau would be immensely proud (Ref: Civil Disobedience) – we have one person to credit: President Donald Trump, who, as it turns out, has taught more people more about civics than anyone else. Who would have thought?\nIrony is often a thing of beauty.",

        "text": "If you’re retired, what should you do about recent gyrations in the stock market? During 2024, the S&P 500 gained 25% when you include the return from dividends. In 2025, however, it’s fluctuated significantly due to concerns about a possible recession caused by pending tariffs and layoffs. Depending on which day you checked, the return on the S&P 500 could have been down 5% or more.\nAdding to investors’ anxiety are the predictions that the stock market is currently overvalued and is headed for a significant decline in the near future.\nLet’s look at a historical perspective on stock market returns that can help retirees evaluate their investments. Then let’s examine three possible responses retirees may want to take.\nMost Of The Time, But Not Always, The Stock Market Has Earned Positive Returns\nFigure 1 in the chart below shows the annual return in the S&P 500 since 1926, including the return from dividends. This chart provides a visual of the following conclusion: Most of the time, but not always, you’ll earn more money by remaining invested in the stock market.\nThe numbers confirm the stock market “double-double” advantage:\n- There are far more years of positive returns than negative returns—the score is 73 positive years to 26 negative years.\n- The arithmetic average gain in positive years is much more than the average loss in negative years. The score is an average positive return of 21.7%, compared to an average negative loss of 13.4%.\nThe chart also shows that if you’re invested in the stock market during your retirement, you should be prepared for some years of negative returns—it’s inevitably going to happen. Historically, however, if you were patient and stayed invested, the market eventually bounced back and you most likely would have experienced a net gain. This observation might be most relevant for retirees in their 50s, 60s, or early 70s who could be retired for 20 years or more and have the time to be patient.\nIt’s important to remember that most people—professionals and amateurs alike—don’t have a reliable crystal ball that warns them when the stock market will drop or alerts them when the market is about to take off. This means you’ll need to develop strategies to protect your retirement income and lifestyle without knowing when the market might crash.\nWith these observations in mind, let’s look at three possible strategies you might consider for your retirement investments.\nStrategy #1: Keep Calm And Carry On\nWith this perspective, you wouldn’t make significant changes to your asset allocation for investments that generate retirement cashflow, since you’ve developed a careful strategy to ride out downturns. Here are two strategies that serve this purpose, supported by research I’ve conducted at the Stanford Center on Longevity:\n- Have enough regular retirement income that won’t decrease if the stock market crashes. How much is “enough”? An amount that prevents you from panicking and selling your investments when the stock market is dropping. One possibility is to cover most, if not all, of your “must have” living expenses with protected sources of retirement income. Examples of such protected income include Social Security, pensions, income annuities, and cash flow from a bond ladder.\n- For your regular, systematic withdrawals from invested assets, be prepared to reduce your withdrawals when the market is down and not overspend when the market is up. This can help minimize your long-term losses due to sequence-of-returns risk—the risk that you’ll withdraw so much during downturns that you won’t have sufficient assets with which to bounce back when the market turns up again.\nYou can implement this second strategy by using a dynamic withdrawal method to determine the annual amount of your withdrawals. Such a method automatically reduces your withdrawals during downturns and limits withdrawals during upturns. The IRS required minimum distribution is one example of a dynamic withdrawal method that research shows has worked well in the past.\nStrategy #2: Declare Victory\nThis strategy might be most appropriate for retirees in their mid 70s or older who have a more limited investing horizon or for retirees who are very conservative with their investments.\nWith this strategy, you decide that while you’ve had a good ride in the stock market, the ride is over. The S&P 500 has had positive returns in 14 of the 16 years since the 2008 financial crisis, with the one significant loss in 2022 attributable to the pandemic. You could decide that you’ve enjoyed cumulative returns far higher than what you expected when you retired. Even if you lost 5% in 2025, you’re still way ahead given your gains in 2024 and earlier.\nSo, it could be time to declare victory and secure your gains. In this case, you’d shift a significant amount of your stock market investments to cash, bonds, or income annuities.\nKeep in mind that if you sell stock investments with significant gains, you could incur capital gains taxes on investments that are not invested in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as IRAs, 401k, 403b, or 457 accounts.\nStrategy #3: Modest Refinements And Careful Watching\nThis strategy is a hybrid of the two strategies described above. With this approach, you’d make modest changes to your asset allocation, such as rebalancing your money between stocks and bonds towards a specified goal. It could also include converting some of your invested assets to a low-cost income annuity or bond ladder, while still maintaining some stock market investments. Finally, it could include building cash reserves to help ride out future downturns.\nThe best investment strategy for you would generate sufficient cashflow to support the life you want, while helping you sleep at night without money worries interrupting your dreams. No matter where you are in your retirement journey, it’s worth your time to periodically review your investment and retirement income strategies with these goals in mind.",

        "text": "One of the most highly anticipated celestial events of the year in North America, a total lunar eclipse, will occur overnight on Thursday-Friday, March 13-14. Colloquially known as a “blood moon,” sky-watchers, astronomers and photographers will be outside for many hours for an unforgettable night, but if you just want a quick glance of the totally eclipsed moon, there’s a key time to set your alarm for.\nHere’s everything you need to know to have a quick look, maximize your experience and even capture stunning images of an event that won’t be repeated in North America until 2029.\nBlood Moon 2025: What Is A Total Lunar Eclipse?\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon passes into Earth’s shadow in space. During the 65 minutes of totality, the full moon will take on a reddish hue caused by sunlight filtering through Earth’s atmosphere — hence the term “blood moon.”\nDespite the name, the lunar surface will likely turn a more orange, pink and brown color, rather than blood-red.\nBlood Moon 2025: When And Where To Watch\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible across the Americas, with all U.S. states, Canada and Mexico having a clear view of the entire event, weather permitting. Although there are penumbral and partial phases to enjoy, here’s the timeline for totality—that 65 minutes of a completely red moon:\n- Eastern: totality from 2:26-3:31 a.m. EDT on Friday, March 14.\n- Central: totality from 1:26-2:31 a.m. CDT on Friday, March 14.\n- Mountain: totality from 12:26-1:31 a.m. MDT on Friday, March 14.\n- Pacific: totality from 11:26 p.m. PDT on Thursday, March 13 to 12:31 a.m. PDT on Friday, March 14.\n- Alaska: totality from 10:26-11:31 p.m. AKDT on Thursday, March 13.\n- Hawaii: totality from 8:26-9:31 p.m. HST on Thursday, March 13.\nAlthough totality is what most observers are most interested in seeing, it’s highly recommended to observe for an hour on either side of these times to watch the partial phases, when it’s possible to see the edge of Earth’s shadow sweep across the lunar surface — an incredible sight!\nBlood Moon 2025: Your Eclipse Toolkit\nTo ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience, gather these essential items before planning a session to view the “blood moon:\"\n- An alarm and back-up alarm to wake you up.\n- Warm clothes.\n- A reclining chair and blanket.\n- Hot drinks and snacks.\n- Any pair of binoculars (or a telescope) for close-up views.\n- Camera or smartphone, plus a tripod.\nBlood Moon 2025: When To See The Milky Way\nThe only thing you need to see the “blood moon” is a clear sky. However, if you are away from light pollution, it may also be possible to briefly see stars around the totally eclipsed moon, as well as the Milky Way. During March, the Milky Way is visible from the Northern Hemisphere as an arc of starlight in the east — exactly as totality gets underway.\nThe glare from a full moon always makes it impossible to see wherever you view from, but not when there’s a “blood moon.” With its light briefly dimmed, it should become visible. That’s why astrophotographers will be heading to Dark Sky Places and remote areas away from urban light pollution.\nBlood Moon 2025: Chance Of Seeing The Northern Lights\nSolar maximum means there’s currently a heightened chance of a display of the Northern Lights, also known as the aurora borealis. That goes double in March, when the Earth’s axis is perpendicular to the sun, making it easier for the solar wind to interact with the atmosphere. This so-called “equinox effect” may potentially result in aurora being visible during the eclipse, though that would depend on a geomagnetic storm being ongoing.\nIn any case, those in Alaska, Canada, and the U.S. states along the U.S.-Canada border will have the greatest chance. If this looks like a possibility (check NOAA’s space weather forecast), head away from light-polluted urban areas for the best views.\nBlood Moon 2025: Where To Livestream The Eclipse\nIf cloudy skies threaten your view, don’t give up—all you need is a brief break in the clouds during totality. If it’s a bust, visit Timeanddate for a reliable livestream from its mobile observatory in the U.S, with contributors around the world.\nBlood Moon 2025: How To Photograph It With A Smartphone\nThe best way to photograph the eclipse with a smartphone is to hold it up against the eyepiece of any telescope, with impressive results possible. Other techniques include using a tripod or stabilizing your phone on a flat surface and attaching a clip-on telephoto lens to magnify the moon. The latter will get you only a souvenir photo.\nBlood Moon 2025: When Is The Next Eclipse?\nThe following total lunar eclipse will occur on Sept. 7, 2025, though it will be best seen in Asia, with North America on the Earth’s dayside at the time. A total lunar eclipse will follow on March 3, 2026, which the western half of North America will get a good view of. The next total lunar eclipse visible to the entire U.S. will be on June 25-26, 2029.\nWishing you clear skies and wide eyes.",

        "text": "Topline\nMarch’s stock market selloff showed no signs of easing Thursday as major indexes closed at their lowest points of the year, sending the S&P 500 into a correction amid intensifying backlash to President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, which have resulted in retaliatory measures from Canada, China and the European Union.\nKey Facts\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, marking its lowest point of the year and sliding into a market correction, as it is now down 10.1% from the all-time high it reached less than a month ago.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a year-to-date low, closing down 537 points.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 2%, marking its lowest point so far this year.\nThe losses continue a larger market selloff that began last week, bringing the Dow and S&P 500 to their lowest intraday prices since September.\nThe slump follows Trump’s 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, which were met with tens of billions of dollars’ worth of retaliatory tariffs from the European Union and Canada.\nIn response to retaliatory trading measures from the U.S. allies, Trump ratcheted up threats for more counter-tariffs against the EU and Canada, threatening Thursday to introduce a 200% tariff on wines, champagne and other alcohol products imported to the U.S. from European Union countries.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nHow Are Tesla Shares Performing?\nShares of electric vehicle maker Tesla, which has experienced a rough week of trading, closed down 3% Thursday to $240.68, erasing its gains from Wednesday. The electrical vehicle maker, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, is down around 40% year-to-date.\nWhat Is A Market Correction?\nA correction is when markets drop 10% or more from peak levels. What is particularly notable about the S&P 500’s correction is that it comes less than a month after its all-time high of 6,144.15 in February. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note the S&P 500 usually experiences three setbacks between 5% and 10% every year on average.\nKey Background\nTrump’s 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports took effect Wednesday morning. Canada then announced its own trade duties on roughly $21 billion worth of American goods, including levies on about $8.8 billion of steel products and $2.1 billion of aluminum goods. The longtime U.S. ally also briefly imposed a 25% surcharge on electricity from Ontario going to about 1.5 million homes and businesses in the U.S and later suspended the charges after Trump threatened to increase steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. The European Union plans to impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. in April. China has also levied its own retaliatory tariffs, imposing 15% trade duties on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and 10% tariffs on other agricultural products after Trump enacted a 10% tariff on Chinese products.\nFurther Reading\nTrump’s Tariffs Trigger Clash Between China And Walmart—What To Know (Forbes)\nTrump Threatens 200% Tariff On EU Alcohol—Including French Wine (Forbes)\nTrump Tariff Backlash: Canada, EU Retaliate Over Steel And Aluminum Tariffs (Forbes)",

        "text": "While organizations continue to discuss RTO (return-to-work) policies with employees, no one disputes that digital communication will take up a larger percentage of the workday, even among teams in the same building.\nDr. Andrew Brodsky, a management professor at the University of Texas, Austin, believes leaders can leverage all forms of digital communication (text/email/audio/video) to build trust, strengthen relationships, and motivate teams.\nI contacted Brodsky to discuss his new book, Ping, which reveals simple tactics to get the most out of virtual meetings. We met virtually, of course, over Zoom, to speak about four strategies to elevate the quality of remote video conversations.\nBrodsky taught me that scientists measure the richness of communication by looking at two dimensions: Cues (facial expressions, tone of voice, body language, gestures) and synchronicity (real-time or delayed communication).\nFor example, in-person meetings and presentations score highest for “richness” because they’re in real-time, and we can read each other’s cues. Video calls fall slightly below in-person meetings because small differences can significantly erode engagement.\nBrodsky says simply paying attention to these slight differences will elevate the impact of your remote conversations.\n1. Take more pauses.\n“Research shows that those tiny lags in virtual video communication, even less than a second, cause interruptions and make conversations more difficult,\" says Brodsky.\nThe problem, says Brodsky, is that when we’re in person, we get more cues when to speak. On video, those cues are minimal or confusing. The result is a lot of extra interruptions and awkward silences that make collaboration difficult.\nWe’ve all experienced the awkwardness of talking over each other: “Oh, no. Sorry. Go ahead. Sorry for interrupting. Oh, you’re done? Ok. Sorry…”\nThe trick, especially if you’re leading a meeting, is to pause more and slightly longer than you would in person. Leave enough time to make sure the person on the other end is finished with their thought.\nNo, we’re not talking about an uncomfortably long and awkward pause of ten seconds. But a pause that’s enough to take in what the person said. In fact, a short pause and a simple nod of approval will show others that you’re listening.\n2. Prove your engaged.\nLet’s say you’re looking at notes during the meeting—notes that relate to the subject. In a “high cue” environment like being in person, others can see that you’re referring to notes. In lower cue environments like video calls, your colleagues might think you’re disengaged and answering texts on your phone.\nBe explicit and tell people what you’re doing. For example, “I’m writing down your observation, Susan. I think it’s valuable, and I’d like to circle back to it before we end this meeting.”\nProve you’re engaged.\n3. Turn on the webcam to build rapport. Turn it off to be productive.\nYou can’t show that you’re engaged if your webcam is off. Turn it on.\nSurveys find that most managers assume—incorrectly, at times—that employees without their webcams on are disengaged from the conversation. As an employee, you can use assumption to your advantage. For example, if there are 20 people in the meeting and most have turned off their webcams, then you should turn it on. Your boss will notice.\nIf you’re the boss, however, set expectations. According to Brodsky’s research, ‘Zoom fatigue’ is real. The presence of a camera creates anxiety, stress, and cognitive overload. If you’re leading a meeting where everyone knows each other and the purpose it to get work done, tell people it’s okay to turn off their cameras so the team can focus on the project.\nHowever—and this is key—if the people on a call do not know each other well or rarely see each other face to face, then leave the webcams on.\nRemember, those “cues” are crucial for building rapport with one another.\n4). Set the stage.\nOne of the toughest challenges of remote communication is building rapport and trust with colleagues, clients, or customers.\nTurn the remote setting into an opportunity to build trust by giving people a glimpse of your personal interests. “People bond over shared interests,” Brodsky reminded me as we talked about the photo of his two rescue dogs that was placed behind him. In my background, Brodsky saw some of the names of the books I read and a bottle of wine, which led to a conversation about where I live in California’s wine country.\nPay attention to what your setting says about you. If you’re a boss or team leader, choose photos that humanize you or offer some insight into your hobbies and interests. Take the opportunity to add to the richness of the conversation.\nDigital communication tools aren’t going anywhere, even if two people are sitting near each other in adjoining cubicles. And there will always be customers or clients who prefer it. So, don’t wring your hands over it. Instead, adapt and use these to stand out.",

        "text": "Endear, a comprehensive CRM platform, elevates customer engagement by tailoring interactions based on shoppers’ preferences. With personalized messaging and data-driven insights, Endear’s CRM empowers store-level teams to create meaningful connections with consumers, encouraging customer loyalty and driving visits and average order values.\nThe company on March 31 will launch Appointments, a tool designed to help retailers create in-store experiences that drive higher engagement, foot traffic and conversions. The feature will allow brands to seamlessly book personalized shopping sessions such as styling consultations, tailoring and private shopping events directly within Endear’s CRM.\nRetailers will integrate appointment scheduling into clienteling workflows, ensuring that store associates can manage bookings, track past interactions and follow up with customers, all in one place. Unlike generic scheduling tools, Endear’s solution will tie each appointment to a customer profile, allowing brands too leverage. past purchase history and preferences to deliver one-on-one service.\nRetailers don’t always have a way to influence foot traffic at their locations and ultimately, that’s what decides their ability to reach their sales goals and drive revenue for the company. Different from e-commerce, once a customer decides to walk into a store, there’s a 30 percent chance that he or she will purchase.\n“That’s really high, but those purchases are completely dependent on the consumer’s sort of arbitrary whim to visit that store so our goal is to give retail teams the ability to influence that and provide incentive,” said Leigh Sevin, co-founder of Endear. “They don’t have to be financial incentives, but should give customers a proactive reason to come and visit the store. By doing that, you have a huge ability to control your own destiny and make sure that the store ends up reaching its goals.”\nScheduling appointments in stores is important because the conversion rate goes up to 90 percent for someone planning to visit a retailer in person. “You’re almost guaranteeing yourself a sale,” Sevin said. “That’s a really high-intent customer. You’ve probably had time to think about what that customer is interested in and curate a shopping selection that fits that customer’s needs. You’ve had time to prepare and the customer has had time to prepare.”\nEndear repopulates a number of a retailer’s audiences. Take neighborhood audiences. Endear shows a retailer all the customers that have shopped on its brand’s web site and live within a certain radius of a store, say 5 miles. There’s an online shopper that can be turned into an omnichannel customer, which has a 30% higher lifetime value. This shopper’s average order values tend to be much higher, return rates are lower and conversion rates are much higher.\n“The value of that customer can be dramatically increased by getting them to come into the store,” said Sevin. “If they already know your brand, it’s a very low-hanging fruit audience. They just might not have known that you were so close by. Being able to experience the brand in real life rather than just online has a huge influence over lifetime value.”\n“What I love about what we do and what our customers do, is they realize that e-commerce doesn’t compete against retail,\" Sevin said. “These aren’t two companies. It’s about how brands show up in those channels. What we do is we really help brands accomplish a much more successful omnichannel strategy. If you’re going to open a store, you probably already have a web site. What’s your competitive advantage for opening a store? It means that the customer can come in and touch and feel your product. The reason why we’re so excited about Appointments is that web sites have less than a 1% conversion rate.”\nEndear believes strongly in customer service and customer success, which it leverages with SalesChat. The interface uses store associates for the benefit of a retailer’s ecommerce customers, facilitating answers for the latter from the former. “When an ecommerce customer has a question about a product, we believe that they should talk to an expert and the experts live in your stores,” Sevin said. “It’s another example of a resource that you have that your ecommerce-only competitor doesn’t, so let’s let your ecommerce-only customers benefit from those resources.”\nBut the heart of Endear is clienteling and what makes the company’s approach unique is the scalability and data access it offers. “We got our start by making clienteling more accessible from a price point and implementation perspective,” Sevin said. “We publish our pricing, It’s straightforward. We’re a one click integration. We don’t want brands to need a development team to get started. What that means is that most of the integrations are one click, you don’t need any sort of tech resources, there’s no down time. Most of our brands are able to start generating sales within two weeks of implementing Endear.”\nBrands agree. “Endear’s appointment feature has been instrumental to our clienteling efforts and ultimately, the success of our stores,” said Samuel Johnson, retail director of Eleventy USA. “We strive to create a special experience for our clients and Endear Appointments allows us to structure client visits to ensure their trusted stylist is available to assist. The appointment system encourages clients to shop at designated times rather than simply showing up unannounced. This enables better planning and personalized service such as preparing preferred styles and sizes and even having the client’s preferred cocktail waiting for them upon arrival.”",

        "text": "A recently uncovered Amazon patent provides critical insights into how the company is merging Alexa's voice capabilities with Rufus's product intelligence to create a more sophisticated shopping assistant. This integration represents a potential breakthrough in Amazon's decade-long quest to make voice shopping mainstream—a vision that has remained largely unfulfilled despite the company's significant investments in voice technology since Alexa's 2014 launch.\nThe patent reveals a system that can answer broad product questions by analyzing attributes across multiple listings, representing a fundamental shift from traditional search to conversational product discovery. By combining Alexa's voice interface with Rufus's deep product knowledge, Amazon appears to be addressing the core limitations that have historically prevented voice from becoming a significant product discovery channel.\nThe Alexa-Rufus Integration\nThe patent (US 12,141,529), which was authored by members of the same team behind Amazon’s Rufus product assistant, reveals a technology framework that combines Alexa’s voice interface with Rufus’s advanced product knowledge. According to Andrew Bell, an Amazon E-commerce Manager who analyzed the patent, this integration goes beyond simple voice shopping commands to enable sophisticated product research through natural conversation.\n\"This is Alexa voice technology and Rufus product intelligence coming together for one unified product shopping experience,\" Bell explains.\nThis integration represents a significant milestone in Amazon's voice commerce strategy. Since launching Alexa in 2014, the company has struggled to make voice shopping mainstream despite its early promise. Initial versions of Alexa could handle basic shopping commands like reordering items or adding products to lists, but lacked the sophisticated product knowledge and conversational abilities needed for complex shopping journeys.\nThe patent signals Amazon's solution to this long-standing challenge—combining Alexa's voice interface with the deep product intelligence that Rufus has demonstrated since its launch earlier this year. Rather than treating them as separate assistants with different capabilities, Amazon appears to be creating a unified system that can handle the entire shopping journey through natural conversation.\nThe technology enables Alexa+ to handle broad, category-level questions that previous voice assistants couldn't address effectively. Rather than just responding to specific product queries, the system can now process questions like \"How long are pocket knives?\" or \"Do jeans shrink after washing?\" by aggregating data across multiple products.\nHow Alexa’s New Technology Works\nThe patent describes a multi-stage process for answering these broad product questions:\n- User Query Processing: The system analyzes questions using named entity recognition to identify key product categories and attributes\n- Data Collection & Analysis: It then finds relevant products, extracts their attributes, and determines which product characteristics are most relevant to the question\n- Answer Generation: Finally, it aggregates data from multiple products and uses templates to create natural, conversational responses\nFor example, when asked \"Do jeans shrink after washing?\", Alexa could respond: \"Based on 32 jeans, most (87%) shrink slightly after washing,\" and then suggest relevant products.\nBell notes that the system’s sophistication extends to understanding context and providing nuanced answers. \"It shows the deep research that's being done, in particular to products,\" he says, adding that for questions like \"Can I put plastic plates in the dishwasher?\", the system might respond \"The answer is yes for these 34 products and no for 8 products,\" offering a much more detailed response than was previously possible.\nThis capability fundamentally transforms the traditional shopping journey. Rather than requiring consumers to manually review dozens of product listings to find dishwasher-safe plates, Alexa+ automatically performs this research and presents aggregate findings. The shopping journey flips from \"find products, then research attributes\" to \"specify attributes, then discover qualifying products.\" This approach eliminates significant friction in the product research phase and potentially accelerates purchase decisions by providing instant comparative analysis across multiple products.\nBeyond Voice Commands To Conversational Shopping\nThis development marks a significant evolution from Alexa's original voice shopping capabilities, which were primarily limited to reordering items or adding products to carts via specific commands.\nAmazon's forthcoming Alexa+ announcement already hints at this advanced functionality. The company's promotional materials emphasize a more conversational, context-aware experience, stating Alexa+ will be \"more conversational, smarter, personalized—and she helps you get things done.\"\nMichelle Grant, Director of Strategy and Insights for Retail and Consumer Goods at Salesforce, points out that combining voice with visual interfaces may finally overcome previous barriers to voice commerce. \"I think the true barrier to voice commerce was the lack of a screen,\" Grant noted in a comment on LinkedIn. \"It's telling that the first Amazon devices to get Alexa+ will be Echo Shows.\"\nPersonalization Powers Relevance\nA key aspect of the patent is its emphasis on personalization. According to Bell, the system incorporates users’ historical transactions, items added to cart, purchase rates, and related searches when determining relevant products to include in responses.\nThis confirms what early analysis of Rufus had previously suggested. When I covered early analysis of Rufus’s indexing mechanisms for Forbes in late 2024, tests indicated potential personalization in results, with different users receiving varying product recommendations for identical queries. The patent now provides concrete evidence that personalization is indeed a core design element of Amazon's product intelligence system, not just an observational anomaly.\nLauren Morgenstein Schiavone, an AI and business strategy consultant and former P&G executive, sees this as transformative: \"Alexa will pick up on lifestyle details like who's in your household, what activities you do, and even seasonal needs so she can recommend the right products at the right time.\"\nThis personalization extends to proactive recommendations and predictive purchasing. As Amazon describes in its Alexa+ announcement, \"The new Alexa is highly personalized... She knows what you've bought, what you've listened to, the videos you've watched, the address you ship things to, and how you like to pay.\"\nImplications For Consumers\nFor shoppers, this evolution creates a more intuitive discovery path that mirrors how people naturally think about products. Rather than having to search for specific terms, consumers can ask general questions about product categories, usage, and attributes—closer to how they might ask a knowledgeable friend or store associate.\nThe system's ability to aggregate information across multiple products also provides a form of automatic comparison shopping, presenting ranges, averages, and distributions of product attributes that would otherwise require reviewing numerous individual listings.\nHowever, the ultimate impact will depend on adoption. Previous iterations of voice shopping never fully took off despite early enthusiasm. Amazon appears to be addressing historical limitations by:\n- Combining voice with visual interfaces through Echo Show devices and a new mobile experience\n- Making conversations more natural through advanced NLP capabilities\n- Creating a more personalized experience that learns from interactions and purchases\n- Ensuring cross-device continuity so conversations can move from home to mobile seamlessly\nLooking Ahead\nAs Amazon begins rolling out Alexa+ in the US market, starting with Echo Show devices, the true test will be whether this enhanced assistant can overcome the historical limitations of voice commerce and create a genuinely useful product discovery experience.\nBell believes the groundwork has been laid for a significant leap forward: \"This patent shows a voice-activated product queries system through Alexa's voice processing with deep product knowledge response powered by Rufus's capabilities.\"\nWhat remains to be seen is how this shift will impact brands selling on Amazon’s platform, which I’ll be posting about here on Forbes tomorrow (sign up for updates so you don’t miss it). The next-generation assistant could significantly alter how shoppers discover products, potentially requiring brands to rethink their listing strategies and content creation approaches.",

        "text": "Topline\nThe Department of Education has started shuttering offices and instituting layoffs affecting approximately half its workforce this week—one of several steps President Donald Trump’s administration is taking that could affect how the government handles federal student loans and student loan forgiveness.\nKey Facts\nDepartment of Education Job Cuts: The Education Department announced Tuesday it plans to lay off approximately 50% of its workforce and shutter some offices, after approximately a quarter of the Office of Student Aid’s employees had already previously been laid off or accepted buyouts, according to CNN.The job cuts could hamper the agency’s ability to process payments or to manage a potential increase in defaults as some affordable payment plans end, CNN notes, with a former Education Department staffer telling the outlet that workers who would typically write emails warning borrowers before they default “have been fired,” adding, “It’s almost like the government doesn’t even want to get paid.”\nDepartment of Education Dismantling: It’s still unclear what could happen to the federal student loans program if the Department of Education is officially dissolved by Congress: Trump has said he doesn’t think the student loans program should be under the Education Department and floated it could be moved to the Small Business Administration, Treasury or Commerce Department.\nThe changeover would not affect borrowers’ loans themselves, but there could be a period in which it would be difficult to get applications processed, or a greater number of errors in the system as accounts are transferred over, experts told NBC 10 Philadelphia.\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness: Trump signed an executive order March 7 that seeks to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows public servants to be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years of service, saying in his order that employees who work for organizations opposed to his policies—like groups that support transgender rights or undocumented immigrants—should not be eligible for the loan forgiveness.\nTrump's executive order targeting the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program only seeks proposed revisions to the program at this time, and requires Congressional approval, so borrowers who are public servants are not yet affected.\nSAVE Plan: The Biden-era plan to allow lower monthly payments based on borrowers' income appears finished; the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan was blocked in federal court in February and the Trump administration is unlikely to try to revive it, with one staffer at the Office of Student Aid telling CNN, “We’ve been told ‘SAVE’ is not coming back in any way, shape, or form.”\nIncome-Driven Repayment Plans: The Trump administration also paused applications to other income-driven repayment plans for at least three months, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post, and suggested other plans based on borrowers’ incomes could also be unlawful.\nThe Education Department’s lawyers will decide when the applications will reopen, CNN reported, noting any income-driven plans that come back “are expected to be more costly for borrowers.”\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau: The Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency are taking steps to dismantle the CFPB, a consumer protection agency that’s taken numerous steps against predatory behavior by student loan companies, with the Student Borrower Protection Center reporting the agency has obtained more than $5 billion in relief for Americans with student debt and taken steps that have led to the Department of Education canceling $188.8 billion in debt for borrowers.\nThe Trump administration appears to be halting the agency’s work on investigating student loan issues: It fired the CFPB’s student loan ombudsman as part of cuts to the agency’s workforce—a move that the former ombudsman, Julia Barnard, said in a statement would “cost real people real money”—and withdrew a lawsuit against a Pennsylvania-based loan servicer, which the Biden administration alleged unlawfully collected student loans that borrowers had discharged when filing for bankruptcy.\nCrucial Quote\nColleen Campbell, the executive director of the Office of Student Aid’s Office of Loan Portfolio Management, said in a public LinkedIn post in February announcing her new role that the change was “somewhat bittersweet,” noting she had already lost “many” of the employees she oversees, with “more to come.” “I'm afraid of what the coming days, weeks, months, years will bring not just for me and the Department, but for the borrowers we serve,” Campbell wrote. “I've dedicated my career to the work of supporting college affordability and a student aid system that supports our most vulnerable, and it is heartbreaking to see that dissolving before my eyes.” In an updated post on LinkedIn Wednesday, Campbell announced she had opted to leave the Education Department.\nWhat Other Student Loan Programs Could Be Affected?\nIt’s still unclear what other impacts student loan borrowers could face, though more programs could be under threat, both from the Trump administration and Congress’ Republican majority. A number of student loan programs have been identified as being under review, both by the White House—when it froze federal spending, though that’s since been blocked in court—and in a memo from the GOP-controlled House Ways and Means Committee. The reviews include potentially capping the amount of student loans the government can issue, phasing out loan programs covering graduate students and borrowers’ parents, modifying Pell Grants and ending Biden-era programs that provide student loan forgiveness to borrowers who were defrauded by their school or whose schools closed. Lawmakers also suggested they were looking into ending a tax deduction for interest on student loans and subsidies that prevent borrowers from paying interest while they’re still in school. None of those changes have been formalized yet, however, and it’s unclear if any will ultimately end up happening.\nBig Number\n43 million. That’s the approximate number of Americans who had outstanding federal student loans as of fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Education.\nDoes Doge Have Access To Student Loan Data?\nOne major source of concern for borrowers since Trump’s inauguration is whether Musk and his associates at DOGE have access to borrowers’ private student loan data, as reports have indicated. A federal judge blocked DOGE’s access to some Education Department data in a ruling Feb. 24, in response to a lawsuit brought by unions representing federal workers, student loan recipients and veterans who receive benefits or have student loans. That ruling bars the Education Department from sharing private information about the plaintiffs in the case with DOGE officials, and is only temporary until a more lasting order can be issued, however. A different judge previously denied a more sweeping effort by students in the University of California system to block DOGE from accessing student loan data. That ruling is only temporary while the litigation moves forward, however, so a different ruling against DOGE could still be issued in the future. That means DOGE reportedly does have some access to data as of now, though it’s still unclear the full scope of what officials have accessed and how any information is being used.\nIf Doge Mishandles Student Loan Data, Can Your Loans Be Forgiven?\nThe reports on DOGE accessing student loan data sparked a number of claims on social media that borrowers should use Musk’s access to their data to try and have their loans forgiven, claiming DOGE violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and borrowers have the right to challenge their loans in response. There’s no factual basis for those claims, however. FERPA, which broadly prohibits educational institutions from disclosing students’ personal school records without their or their parents’ consent, doesn’t have any private right of action, which means students or borrowers cannot bring lawsuits under the law if they believe their private information has been shared. While it is possible to file a complaint with the government alleging a FERPA violation, those claims will be investigated and enforced by the Education Department—which is unlikely to find any fault or grant relief in this case, given that the department is managed by Trump appointees. Even if any violations were found, the law doesn’t allow for any financial relief to students or borrowers, and instead only says the school or institution that disclosed the information should have their funding revoked.\nWhat Does Project 2025 Say?\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from the far-right policy blueprint Project 2025, and there is no indication he is following its proposals directly. Many of Trump’s actions in office have lined up with policies proposed in Project 2025, however, including the dismantling of the Education Department. Project 2025 proposes the Office of Student Aid should be moved to the Treasury Department if the Education Department is abolished, though it would only oversee collections and defaults of loans. Most of the federal student loan portfolio should be spun off into a new “government corporation” that would be managed by a board of presidentially appointed trustees, Project 2025 proposed. The policy agenda does not advocate for any form of student loan forgiveness, writing, “Borrowers should expect to repay their loans.”\nKey Background\nStudent loans and debt relief have become a growing political issue, as Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have encouraged full student loan forgiveness and made the issue into a central concern for Democrats. The Biden administration imposed a sweeping plan to forgive up to $10,000 of borrowers’ student loans, but the Supreme Court ultimately struck down the policy, ruling in June 2023 the administration exceeded its authority in imposing it. As a result, the Biden administration instead made a series of more targeted moves on student loan forgiveness that focused on specific groups of borrowers, saying in January it had approved $188.8 billion in loan forgiveness for 5.3 million borrowers during Joe Biden’s presidency. Republicans have ramped up their opposition to student loan forgiveness as a result of Democrats’ advocacy for it, with Republican attorneys general filing the lawsuits that ultimately led courts to strike down Biden’s most sweeping proposals, like the universal debt relief plan and the SAVE plan.",

        "text": "Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), best known for its taser and body cams for law enforcement agencies, has had a volatile ride, with its stock falling over 15% in a month, followed by a weakness in broader markets. The S&P500 index is down 8% in a month after the Trump administration’s tariff confirmation on its trade partners including Mexico, Canada, and China. Also, speaking of tariffs, see Trump’s Tariff Policy: The Ripple Effect On Alcoa And Metal Stocks.\nAfter its recent fall, AXON stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $560. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AXON stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high.\nWe arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AXON stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Axon Enterprise along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.\nHow does Axon Enterprise's valuation look vs. the S&P 500?\nGoing by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AXON stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market.\n• Axon Enterprise has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500\n• Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 351.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500\n• And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 134.2 vs. the benchmark's 24.3\nHow have Axon Enterprise's revenues grown over recent years?\nAxon Enterprise's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years.\n• Axon Enterprise has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 30.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)\n• Its revenues have grown 32.4% from $1.5 Bil to $1.9 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)\n• Also, its quarterly revenues grew 31.7% to $544 Mil in the most recent quarter from $413 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)\nHow profitable is Axon Enterprise?\nAxon Enterprise's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.\n• Axon Enterprise's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $114 Mil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 5.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)\n• Axon Enterprise's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $298 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 15.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)\nDoes Axon Enterprise look financially stable?\nAxon Enterprise's balance sheet looks very strong.\n• Axon Enterprise's Debt figure was $721 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $42 Bil (as of 3/12/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.8% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]\n• Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.2 Bil of the $4.0 Bil in Total Assets for Axon Enterprise. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 28.9% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)\nHow resilient is AXON stock during a downturn?\nAXON stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.\nInflation Shock (2022)\n• AXON stock fell 44.8% from a high of $152.87 on 3 January 2022 to $84.37 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500\n• The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 November 2022\n• Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $710.01 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $560\nCovid Pandemic (2020)\n• AXON stock fell 40.8% from a high of $88.90 on 19 February 2020 to $52.61 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500\n• The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 June 2020\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2008)\n• AXON stock fell 85.8% from a high of $18.81 on 9 October 2007 to $2.68 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500\n• The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 February 2014\nPutting all the pieces together: What it means for AXON stock\nIn summary, Axon Enterprise's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:\n• Growth: Extremely Strong\n• Profitability: Weak\n• Financial Stability: Extremely Strong\n• Downturn Resilience: Weak\n• Overall: Strong\nHence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AXON is a tricky stock to buy.\nPreserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios\nNot too happy about the volatile nature of AXON stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nMarket Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth",

        "title": "12 Tips To Make A Refined Green Cocktail For St. Patrick’s Day",

        "text": "Over the years, green cocktails and green beers have become synonymous with St. Patrick’s Day.\nIt all started in the early 1900s in New York City with the introduction of green beer, which was created with blue food coloring. Themed green drinks proliferated across the U.S. and today, whether or not you’re imbibing at an Irish pub, you're likely to find an emerald-hued beverage on the list for the month of March.\nYet, among the green drinks out there, something has changed: Modern mixologists are more likely to use natural ingredients and bar techniques to impart shamrock shades rather than artificial food coloring or overly sweetened liqueurs.\nGreen coloration can be obtained from a variety of chlorophyll-rich plants, advises Logan Rodriguez, head bartender of Smithereens in New York City. “Aromatic herbs can add dimension, tomatillo or poblano pepper can add acidity or vegetal notes, and pistachio can be blended to create a creamy, green orgeat,” he says. “Using algae powder can also bring some bold, bitter, grassy flavors.”\nBelow, Rodriguez and 12 other drinks experts share their tips for how to create a tasteful green cocktail, from tweaking classic recipes to prioritizing layers and garnishes.\nKnow Your Audience\nBefore you even think about the ingredients of your green concoction, you need to understand who you’re making the drink for. Mixologist Billy Ray suggests asking yourself: “Do you want it to be boozy and aromatic for the drinker who loves an old fashioned? Does it need to be shaken and refreshing? Are you making this to impress and get some attention on the ‘gram?” From there, you can confidentially begin to build your recipe—finding your why (outside of “because it’s St. Patrick’s Day”) matters.\nConsider What Green Tastes Like\n“Green isn't a flavor, so if the only objective of the cocktail is the color, it'll be easy to get lost when developing the recipe,” shares Tyler Faust, bartender at The Citizen in Alys Beach, Florida. Dr. Nicola Nice, author of The Cocktail Parlor: How Women Brought the Cocktail Home agrees that the secret to a refined green cocktail is that it doesn’t only look green but most importantly, tastes green. “When I think of the taste of green I think of flavors that are fresh, earthy and herbaceous,” says Nice. “For me that’s going to be anything made with mint (like a mint julep, mojito or grasshopper) or a really verdant liqueur, such as Chartreuse (like a last word).”\nMake A Reduction\nBlanching kale or any green produce can result in a naturally-colored cocktail that also tastes delicious, advises Teddy Collins, bartender at Kiki on The River in Miami. Collins likes to use a fresh pressed cucumber with the skins on for extra color, then balance the reduction with citrus.\nHerbal Infusions\nSome herbs are renowned for their role in cocktails (mint, basil and lavender to name a few), but Rodriguez says there are many flavors from aromatic herbs that are rarely tapped. “Tarragon, shiso or dill can bring a lot of unexpected punch to an infusion or a blended syrup,” says Rodriguez. “Blending these into an herb oil to add a finishing drop onto the cocktail can create a visual and textural heterogeneity that adds a lot of dimension.”\nDon’t Overlook Juicing\n“Whether it's a single drink or you're hosting a party, dust that juicer off and welcome the beginning of spring,” suggests Pat Fraser, global brand ambassador for Cardrona Distillery, who says fresh, pressed green apple juice will provide a perfect shade of green for a St. Patrick’s Day cocktail. Of course, different fruits and vegetables will provide different tastes—green apples are tart and fresh, but try celery for an earthy sip or kiwi for tropical flavors.\nUse Standard Bar Tools\nIf you don’t have a juicer at-home, typical bar techniques can help you attain different shades of green. “Try an infused syrup or a vigorous muddle and shake accompanied with a double strain,” says Don Darling, bartender of Ranger Station in Atlanta, Georgia.\nPractice Restraint And Layering\n“Using ingredients that bring layered flavors rather than just color ensures the cocktail feels intentional rather than gimmicky,” says Riesler Morales, head of mixology, Richard Sandoval Hospitality. Layering can also help to practice restraint in color and taste: “If the color is too intense, it can feel artificial,” says Morales.\nThoughtful Ingredient Pairing\nAs with any cocktail, working with ingredients and flavors that naturally complement each other will result in a successful build, says Australian hospitality veteran Mark Filipelli. “The crispness of fresh cucumber, the delicate earthiness of matcha, the subtle pepperiness of basil, these all go well with and especially enhance the botanicals of gin, rather than overpowering it,” says Filipelli. Whereas Mike Lam, head mixologist at The Bar Downstairs and Kitchen in New York City, suggests blending arugula’s peppery qualities to complement the grassy notes in tequila or mezcal.\nUse Complementary Colors\nOn the note of complementary flavors, visual interest can easily be lost if the shade of the garnish conflicts with the color of the cocktail. For a green drink, Ryan Puckett, beverage director at the Sheraton Grand Nashville Downtown, avoids using red, which could make it appear Christmas-y. Rather, Puckett adds secondary shades of greens with fresh herbs like mint, bright yellow lemon and even blue or purple flowers to really set off the visuals of the green cocktail.\nUtilize The Garnish\nHot take from Nice: you don’t need to colorblock the whole drink to make it St. Patrick’s Day-themed. She emphasizes that “a bright garnish such as a piece of candied lime or bouquet of fresh herbs will look so much more striking against a crisp clear cocktail than it would against a Kermit-the-Frog all green liquid backdrop.”\nBuild On Classic Cocktails\nGreen cocktails don’t need to be revolutionary. “Take a popular classic, like the margarita, gimlet or Tom Collins, and start swapping out the classic components with your flavorful green ingredients,” says Oliver Brooks, beverage operations team brand manager of Pappas Restaurants. For example, riff on a margarita by using kiwi to replace the classic sweeteners of triple sec and agave nectar.\nAvoid Artificial Flavor\n“If it’s not real—don’t use it,” is the motto of Alec Kass, beverage director at Rosevale Cocktail Room in New York City. “I generally avoid any distilled or produced item that starts with ‘green’ unless it ends with ‘Chartreuse,’” Kass adds, mentioning green peas, green tea and green apples are the other notable exceptions. Artificial flavors can make a drink look radioactive while overpowering the palate and throwing the cocktail out of balance. “If you're relying on sour apple schnapps for the color in your drink, chances are you're going to add too much to achieve said color and the drink will just taste like sugary sour apple,” says Ben Bozeman, bar manager of Lucky Cheetah in Portland, Maine.",

        "text": "Robert Spillane became a priority for the New England Patriots as the NFL’s legal tampering window opened.\nBut the veteran linebacker won’t forget when he wasn’t seen as one.\n“I always say it doesn’t happen by accident. It doesn’t happen overnight,” Spillane, 29, told reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium on Thursday. “This has been years in the making, years of intentional actions throughout every day, living my life a certain way to try to get to where I’m at right now.”\nA three-year, $33 million contract worth up to $37.5 million with incentives is where Spillane finds himself now. He stands 86 games, including 50 starts, into a run in the league that began as an undrafted free agent out of Western Michigan.\nAn invitation to rookie minicamp with the Minnesota Vikings arrived in 2018 for the two-time second-team All-MAC selection. Another week passed. Another tryout followed. It sent Spillane to the Tennessee Titans under the watch of a former Ohio State recruiter who would become his past and present head coach.\n“We went out to practice and he didn’t make any mental errors,” Mike Vrabel recalled on Thursday. “He was athletic. He was excellent in this open-field tackling drill. Did the same thing the next day, did the same thing on Sunday. You know, it got to be a joke where we would just keep throwing him in and be like, ‘Hey, let’s see if somebody can make Spillane miss.’ Jon Robinson and I were just like, ‘We have to have him on the football team. I think he’s earned the right to be here based on those three days.’”\nOn Mother’s Day that May, Spillane’s first NFL contract brought him onto a roster of 90 in Nashville. As that roster reduced to 53 following a preseason featuring 25 tackles, one sack and one interception, he was retained on the practice squad in September.\nA promotion came in October. So did additional back-and-forth transactions. But the door had been opened.\n“It was pretty special, especially for me being a young football coach or a young head coach to be able to see a player that had earned the right,” added Vrabel, the 16th head coach in Patriots history. “Like, we didn’t hand him anything. That’s what we want for every single player on our team. We want them to earn everything that they get. And that was an example of what he earned – his opportunity in the National Football League. So, that’s no surprise the career he’s had based on how it started.”\nSpillane would go on to spend four NFL campaigns with the Pittsburgh Steelers, carving a place in the kicking game as well as in sub packages. Then it was on to the Las Vegas Raiders for 2023 and 2024.\nStarting every contest over that span in the AFC West, the 6-foot-1, 229-pound middle linebacker served as a team captain and set new highs with seasons of 148 and 158 tackles along with 1,101 and 1,095 defensive snaps. Now it’s on to Foxborough for the next stage of a career spanning 497 tackles, 8.5 sacks, one forced fumble, two fumble recoveries, six interceptions and one touchdown.\nThe unrestricted free agent’s deal includes $20.6 million fully guaranteed and a $9 million signing bonus, according to OverTheCap.com.\n“I got hired in 2018 on Mother’s Day and I got to call my mom in tears, saying, ‘I’m going to be a professional football player,’” Spillane said. “And today is her birthday, so I’m signing the contract on her birthday. She is a very important and special woman in my life and I just want to make her proud.”",
